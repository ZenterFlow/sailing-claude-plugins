# Test Prompts: Compass Dip and Heeling Error

## Test 1: Basic Magnetic Dip Explanation
**Prompt:** "What is magnetic dip and why does it matter for my compass?"

**Expected Output:**
- Magnetic dip (inclination) definition
- Earth's magnetic field geometry (field lines curve into Earth)
- Hemisphere-specific effects:
  - Northern Hemisphere: north end pulled down
  - Southern Hemisphere: south end pulled down
- Why it matters: Compass needles must be balanced for local dip
- Unbalanced compass: sluggish, inaccurate, increased friction

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Dip angle from 0° (equator) to ±90° (poles)
- Isoclinic lines (lines of equal dip)
- Magnetic equator (aclinic line, 0° dip)
- Physical mechanism (needle aligns with field)

## Test 2: Hemisphere Compass Balancing
**Prompt:** "I'm sailing from UK to Australia. Will my compass work there?"

**Expected Output:**
- UK compass: Northern Hemisphere balanced (Zone 2)
- Australia: Southern Hemisphere location (Zone 4)
- **Compatibility:** NO - wrong hemisphere
- Symptoms in Australia:
  - Sluggish compass response
  - Card drags, slow to settle
  - Reduced accuracy
- Action required: Replace with Zone 4 (SH) compass
- Alternative: Global/universal compass (expensive but works anywhere)

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Hemisphere compatibility critical
- Cannot use opposite hemisphere compass
- Must replace compass when relocating
- Zone markings importance

## Test 3: Sluggish Compass Diagnosis
**Prompt:** "My compass is sluggish and slow to respond. Could this be dip error?"

**Expected Output:**
**Diagnosis questions:**
1. Has vessel changed hemisphere recently?
2. What is local dip angle/latitude?
3. Is compass marked for hemisphere/zone?

**If dip imbalance:**
- Symptoms match dip problem
- Compass balanced for wrong zone
- Solution: Replace with correctly balanced compass

**Other possibilities:**
- Pivot damage/wear
- Friction in bearing
- Air bubble in compass fluid
- Card rubbing on housing

**Immediate mitigation:**
- Accept reduced accuracy
- Take bearings carefully
- Cross-check with GPS
- Plan compass replacement

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Systematic diagnosis approach
- Dip vs. mechanical problems
- No quick fix for dip imbalance

## Test 4: Heeling Error Explanation
**Prompt:** "What is heeling error and when does it affect my compass?"

**Expected Output:**
**Mechanism:**
- Vessel heels → compass tilts
- Vertical magnetic forces get horizontal component
- Horizontal forces get vertical component
- Creates apparent deviation error

**When significant:**
- Sailing vessel heeled >15-20°
- Heavy weather, beating to windward
- Critical navigation in confined waters
- Taking bearings while heeled

**When negligible:**
- Powerboat (<5° heel)
- Sailing vessel upright
- Downwind sailing

**Characteristics:**
- Increases with heel angle
- Varies with heading
- Cannot be corrected with standard deviation table
- Unpredictable magnitude

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Physical mechanism (force components)
- Not standard deviation
- Mitigation strategies needed

## Test 5: Heeling Error Mitigation
**Prompt:** "I'm beating into harbor heeled 25°. How do I deal with heeling error?"

**Expected Output:**
**Mitigation strategies:**
1. **Reduce heel temporarily:**
   - Ease sheets for critical bearing
   - Accept brief speed loss
   - Reduces error by 50-70%

2. **Cross-check with GPS:**
   - Note compass heading
   - Check GPS ground track
   - Account for leeway (~5-10°)
   - Use GPS for primary navigation

3. **Hand-bearing compass:**
   - Hold level (not tilted with vessel)
   - Eliminates heeling error
   - Better for critical bearings

4. **Add safety margin:**
   - Don't trust close tolerances
   - Conservative navigation
   - Multiple position methods

**Action for this scenario:**
25° heel in confined waters = significant heeling error (±7-10°)
- Reduce heel if possible
- Use GPS for primary navigation
- Add extra safety margin
- Consider easing sheets at critical points

**Key Points to Cover:**
- 25° heel is serious
- Multiple mitigation methods
- GPS cross-check essential
- Safety margins critical

## Test 6: Compass Zones and Global Sailing
**Prompt:** "I'm planning a circumnavigation. What compass do I need?"

**Expected Output:**
**Route consideration:**
- Will cross equator (Northern ↔ Southern hemispheres)
- Multiple latitude zones
- Cannot use single hemisphere-specific compass

**Options:**
1. **Global/Universal compass:**
   - Works all latitudes
   - Single compass for voyage
   - Expensive (£400-800)
   - Slightly less accurate than zone-specific
   - Most convenient solution

2. **Two compasses (NH + SH):**
   - Zone 2 (NH) for northern waters
   - Zone 4 (SH) for southern waters
   - Switch at equator crossing
   - Most accurate (each optimized)
   - Cheaper than global (£300-600 total)
   - Requires installation planning

3. **GPS primary + zone compass backup:**
   - Rely on GPS
   - Compass for backup only
   - Replace compass as needed at ports

**Recommendation:** Global/universal compass for convenience

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Equator crossing requires planning
- Multiple solution options
- Cost vs. convenience trade-off
- Installation considerations

## Test 7: Isoclinic Lines Concept
**Prompt:** "Explain isoclinic lines and the aclinic line"

**Expected Output:**
**Isoclinic lines:**
- Lines of equal dip angle on Earth's surface
- Similar to contour lines on map (but for magnetic field angle)
- Roughly parallel to magnetic equator
- Do NOT exactly follow latitude lines (Earth's field irregular)

**Aclinic line (Magnetic Equator):**
- Special isoclinic line where dip = 0°
- Field lines run horizontally at surface
- Roughly follows geographic equator (±5-10° latitude)
- Transition zone between hemispheres
- Compasses from either hemisphere work acceptably here

**Compass zones:**
- Manufacturers design zones around isoclinic bands
- Zone 3 typically equatorial (±20° latitude, ~0-40° dip)
- Zone 2/4 mid-latitudes (~40-70° dip)
- Zone 1/5 high latitudes (~70-85° dip)

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Geographic distribution of dip
- Zone system based on isoclinic bands
- Magnetic equator is aclinic line

## Test 8: Heeling Error Testing
**Prompt:** "How can I test if my compass has heeling error?"

**Expected Output:**
**Simple test (under sail):**
1. Sail steady course on port tack (e.g., close-hauled)
2. Note compass heading: e.g., 045°
3. Tack to starboard, maintain same apparent wind angle
4. Note compass heading: should be ~135° (90° difference)
5. Compare actual difference to expected

**Results interpretation:**
- **No heeling error:** Headings differ by ~90-100° (as expected)
- **Heeling error present:** Significant discrepancy (>5° difference)
- **Example:** Port 045°, Starboard 142° = 97° difference (7° error)

**GPS cross-check method:**
1. Sail heeled on steady heading
2. Note compass heading: e.g., 090°
3. Check GPS ground track: e.g., 085°
4. Account for leeway (~5°): 090° - 5° = 085° expected
5. Compare: Match = accurate, Difference = possible heeling error

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Tack-to-tack comparison method
- GPS cross-check technique
- Interpretation of results
- Leeway consideration

## Test 9: Dip Angle by Latitude
**Prompt:** "What dip angle should I expect in New York vs. Sydney?"

**Expected Output:**
**New York (41°N):**
- Northern Hemisphere
- Mid-latitude (Zone 2)
- Dip angle: ~+70° (field lines angle steeply down)
- Compass requirement: Northern Hemisphere balance

**Sydney (34°S):**
- Southern Hemisphere
- Mid-latitude (Zone 4)
- Dip angle: ~-64° (field lines angle steeply down from above)
- Compass requirement: Southern Hemisphere balance

**Comparison:**
- Similar magnitude (both ~65-70°)
- Opposite hemispheres (opposite signs)
- Both require hemisphere-specific compass
- Northern compass WILL NOT work in Sydney
- Southern compass WILL NOT work in New York

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Latitude-specific dip angles
- Hemisphere distinction critical
- Similar latitudes ≠ compatible compasses

## Test 10: Heeling Error Magnitude Estimation
**Prompt:** "I'm heeled 20° sailing at 50°N latitude. How much heeling error should I expect?"

**Expected Output:**
**Factors:**
- Heel angle: 20° (significant)
- Latitude: 50°N (strong dip angle ~65°)
- Both factors contribute to error

**Estimate:**
- Typical heeling error at 20° heel: ±5-8°
- Higher latitude increases effect: may be upper end
- Varies with heading (some courses worse)
- Expected range: ±5-10°

**Practical impact:**
- Significant for navigation
- Not acceptable for confined waters without mitigation
- GPS cross-check recommended
- Consider reducing heel for critical navigation

**Rule of thumb:**
```
Heel angle → Typical error
0-5°      → 0-1° (negligible)
10-15°    → 2-4° (noticeable)
15-20°    → 3-6° (significant)
20-25°    → 5-8° (serious)
25-30°    → 7-12° (very serious)
```

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Multiple factors affect magnitude
- Not precisely predictable
- Order of magnitude estimates useful
- Mitigation needed for significant heel
