# SKILL: Radar Reflector Installation and AIS Integration (SKILL_108)

## Description
Install, maintain, and integrate radar reflectors and AIS systems to maximize vessel detection by other ships, understanding the complementary roles of both technologies in collision avoidance.

## Prerequisites
- Restricted Visibility Navigation and Radar Reflector Deployment (SKILL_107)

## Learning Objectives
- Select appropriate reflector type based on vessel construction and size
- Install reflector for maximum radar cross-section effectiveness
- Interpret AIS data to supplement radar collision avoidance
- Understand ARPA/MARPA capabilities for target tracking

**Radar Reflector Installation:**

**Reflector Type Selection:**

**Fixed Octahedral Reflector:**
- **Construction:** Rigid plastic or metal plates forming multi-angle reflector
- **Advantages:** Always deployed, superior effectiveness, no deployment action required
- **Disadvantages:** Windage aloft, potential for damage in extreme conditions
- **Best For:** Vessels that regularly operate in shipping lanes or poor visibility

**Collapsible Reflector:**
- **Construction:** Folds flat, opens to octahedral shape with internal springs
- **Advantages:** Lower cost, removable, less windage when stowed
- **Disadvantages:** Manual deployment required, inferior performance to fixed
- **Best For:** Occasional use, budget-conscious, racing vessels where weight critical

**Active (Powered) Reflector:**
- **Construction:** Electronic device that amplifies and returns radar signal
- **Advantages:** Very strong return, adjustable output
- **Disadvantages:** Requires power, more expensive, potential for failure
- **Best For:** Large vessels, commercial applications
- **Limitation:** Not ideal for sailing vessels due to power consumption

**Installation Optimization:**

**Height Requirements:**
- **Minimum Height:** 4 meters above waterline (higher is better)
- **Practical Limit:** Just below masthead to avoid interfering with instruments
- **Motor Vessels:** Mount on radar arch, mast, or pole on cabin top
- **Sailing Vessels:** Mast-mounted, preferably in permanent position

**Positioning for Maximum RCS:**
- **Clear Line of Sight:** No rigging, antennas, or equipment blocking reflector faces
- **Free Rotation:** On sailing vessels, allow reflector to
