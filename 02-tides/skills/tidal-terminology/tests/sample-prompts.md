# Sample Test Prompts for Tidal Terminology

## Definition Questions (Exact answers required)
1. "Define Chart Datum"
2. "What is MHWS?"
3. "Explain the difference between HAT and LAT"
4. "What does MLWN stand for and what does it mean?"

## Application Questions
5. "The chart shows a depth of 8.5m. The tide height is 3.2m. What is the total depth?"
6. "A rock has drying height 2.3m (underlined). Tide is 4.5m. How much water is over the rock?"
7. "A bridge has clearance '22m' marked. Is this above HAT or MHWS? How do I know?"

## Calculation Problems
8. "MHWS is 6.2m, MLWS is 0.8m. What is the spring range?"
9. "I have draught 2.2m and need 0.5m UKC. Drying height is 1.7m. What minimum tide height do I need?"
10. "Charted depth 4.8m, tide at MLWS 0.8m, draught 2.5m. What's my under-keel clearance?"

## Identification Questions
11. "Look at this data: HAT 7.0m, MHWS 6.2m, MHWN 4.8m, MLWN 2.2m, MLWS 0.8m. Calculate both spring and neap ranges."
12. "Which datum should be used for: a) bridge clearances, b) light elevations, c) charted depths?"
13. "Test me on all 8 tidal terms: HAT, LAT, MHWS, MLWS, MHWN, MLWN, CD, Range"

## Advanced Scenarios
14. "Chart shows '35m' for a lighthouse. What datum is this above? How do I find the total height above CD?"
15. "Older chart vs modern chart - what's the difference in how bridge clearances might be marked?"
