# Sample Test Prompts

## Test 1: Basic Calculation
**Prompt**: "Light is 20m high. My height of eye is 4m. What's the dipping distance?"
**Expected**: Calculate using formula, provide total range ~13nm.

## Test 2: Chart Comparison
**Prompt**: "Chart shows light range 15M. Dipping distance is 12nm. Which matters?"
**Expected**: Explain dipping distance is less, so light visible at 12nm (not 15M).
