# Life Jacket Inspection, Maintenance, and Usage

## Purpose
Perform systematic inspection and maintenance of life jackets while enforcing proper usage protocols to ensure maximum survivability in man overboard situations for all crew members including children.

## Description
This skill covers pre-use inspection procedures, inflation system verification, RYA usage policy enforcement, harness attachment protocols, child-specific requirements, and maintenance schedules.

## Activation Triggers
Use this skill when you need to:
- Conduct thorough life jacket inspection
- Fit life jackets correctly with crotch strap and harness
- Enforce RYA usage policy based on risk conditions
- Select appropriate life jacket type for children
- Understand integral harness requirements

## Behaviour

### Pre-Use Inspection Procedure

**Bladder and Fabric Check:**
- Exterior examination for abrasion, tears, UV damage
- Crevice inspection at folding creases where bladder wears most
- Seam integrity check for unraveling or separation
- Reflective tape verification (SOLAS-grade adhesion)

**Inflation System Verification:**
1. **Gas Bottle Inspection:** Remove bottle, check for rust, verify correct size, weigh to confirm not discharged, check threads
2. **Automatic Firing Unit:** Confirm not triggered, test dissolvable tablet if hydrostatic, check for corrosion
3. **Manual Inflation:** Test pull cord operation

**Accessory Functionality Check:**
- Whistle: Blow to confirm sound
- Oral Inflation Tube: Check valve opens and holds air
- Light Operation: Activate water sensor or test battery
- Spray Hood: Deploy and check visibility panels
- Harness Integration: Verify strong attachment points and D-rings

**Crotch Strap Configuration:**
- Adjust so jacket cannot ride up over head when in water
- Should be snug but not restrictive for movement
- Mandatory on all jackets for offshore use

### RYA Usage Policy Enforcement

**Mandatory Wear Situations:**
- **All non-swimmers:** Without exception, at all times
- **Night operations:** Always, with harness attached
- **Fog/restricted visibility:** Always when on deck
- **Reefing:** Before putting in second reef on sailing vessels
- **Dinghy operations:** Always when transferring to/from shore
- **High risk collision situations:** Until cleared from danger
- **Skipper discretion:** Whenever skipper requests
- **Personal choice:** Whenever crew member feels it necessary

### Harness Attachment Protocol

- Use integral harness with harness line to jackstays
- Jackstays: Canvas straps running along each side deck
- Clip on BEFORE leaving cockpit for foredeck work
- Mandatory when working at mast or on foredeck at night/strong conditions/fog
- **NEVER clip to guard rails** - not designed for load and won't prevent MOB

### Child-Specific Requirements

- **Correct Sizing:** Child must be fitted with age/weight-appropriate jacket
- **Oversize Danger:** Using oversized jacket can cause child to slip through and drown
- **Crotch Strap Critical:** Essential to prevent jacket riding up over small shoulders
- **Regular Refitting:** Check fit every trip as child grows

### Jacket Type Selection

**Features to Prioritize:**
- **Integral Harness:** Combined life jacket/harness unit ensures both worn together
- **Spray Hood:** Protects airway from spray/waves, prevents drowning in unconscious casualty
- **Crotch Strap:** Prevents ride-up in water
- **Retro-Reflective Tape:** High visibility for SAR aircraft
- **Light:** Automatic water-activated LED strobe

### Maintenance Schedule

- **Pre-Trip:** Full inspection as detailed above
- **Monthly:** Light test, visual wear check
- **Annually:** Professional service for inflatable models
- **Post-Use:** If inflated, repack according to manufacturer instructions

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Failing to check gas bottle for rust and correct sizing
- Omitting crotch strap adjustment allowing jacket ride-up
- Permitting non-swimmers to be without life jacket
- Clipping harness to guard rails instead of jackstays
- Using oversized life jacket for children
- Not testing light operation before departure
- Storing jackets in damp locker causing bladder deterioration

## Assessment Criteria

Competency demonstrated by:
- Completing full life jacket inspection and identifying potential failure points
- Fitting jacket on adult with proper crotch strap adjustment and harness integration
- Stating conditions requiring mandatory life jacket wear per RYA policy
- Explaining why guard rails are unsuitable for harness attachment
- Selecting appropriate jacket size for child based on weight/age
- Demonstrating manual inflation and oral inflation tube operation
- Showing proper jackstay clip-on procedure for foredeck work
