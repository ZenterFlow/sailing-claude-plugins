# SKILL: Lateral Marks Identification (SKILL_70)

## Description
Identify and interpret port hand and starboard hand lateral marks, including their color schemes, shapes, light characteristics, and passage rules for both IALA regions.

## Prerequisites
- IALA Buoyage System Fundamentals (SKILL_69)

## Learning Objectives
- Distinguish port hand from starboard hand marks
- Apply correct passage rules ("leave to port/starboard")
- Interpret lateral mark light sequences
- Identify preferred channel variants
- Execute safe passage in channels

**Port Hand Mark:**
- **Purpose:** Marks the left side of a channel when proceeding in direction of buoyage
- **Shape:** Can (cylindrical)
- **IALA A Color:** Red body
- **IALA B Color:** Green body
- **Topmark:** Single red can (if fitted)
- **Light Color:** Red (IALA A) or Green (IALA B)
- **Light Sequence:** Any sequence except 2+1
- **Example Sequence:** Q(2)R.2s (2 quick red flashes within 2 seconds)
- **Rule:** Leave to port (pass on your left side)

**Starboard Hand Mark:**
- **Purpose:** Marks the right side of a channel when proceeding in direction of buoyage
- **Shape:** Conical (pointed)
- **IALA A Color:** Green body
- **IALA B Color:** Red body
- **Topmark:** Single green cone (if fitted)
- **Light Color:** Green (IALA A) or Red (IALA B)
- **Light Sequence:** Any sequence except 2+1
- **Example Sequence:** Fl.G3s (1 green flash within 3 seconds)
- **Rule:** Leave to starboard (pass on your right side)

**Preferred Channel to Port (IALA A):**
- **Appearance:** Two green stripes with one red horizontal stripe
- **Treatment:** Act as starboard hand mark for main channel
- **Light Sequence:** Fl(2+1)G.5s (2 flashes, pause, 1 flash within 5 seconds)
- **Secondary Channel:** To port (red side marks)

**Preferred Channel to Starboard (IALA A):**
- **Appearance:** Two red stripes with one green horizontal stripe
- **Treatment:** Act as port hand mark for main channel
- **Light Sequence:** Fl(2+1)R.5s (2 flashes, pause, 1 flash within 5 seconds)
- **Secondary Channel:** To starboard (green side marks)

**Regional Reversal:**
IALA B reverses all color interpretations while maintaining identical shapes and light sequences.

## Common Errors
- Confusing preferred channel marks with regular lateral marks
- Forgetting to invert colors when switching between IALA A and B
- Misidentifying can vs cone shape at distance
- Not recognizing 2+1 light sequence as preferred channel indicator
- Passing on wrong side due to direction of buoyage confusion

## Assessment
- Identify mark type from color, shape, and topmark
- Determine safe passage side for given mark
- Interpret light sequence and timing
- Apply correct regional color scheme
- Navigate through channel with mixed lateral marks
