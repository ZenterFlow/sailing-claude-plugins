## Behaviour

### Risk of Collision Assessment Methods

**Method 1 - Visual Bearings (In Sight)**

**Process:**
1. **Take Initial Bearing:** Note compass bearing to approaching vessel
2. **Monitor Continuously:** Take bearings at regular intervals (every 1-2 minutes)
3. **Assess Bearing Trend:**
   - **Constant Bearing:** High risk of collision
   - **Changing Bearing:** Lower risk (but still monitor)
4. **Evaluate Distance:** If distance decreasing with constant bearing = IMMEDIATE RISK
5. **Consider Speed:** High closure rate reduces reaction time

**Visual Bearings with Compass:**
- **Hand Bearing Compass:** Quick, accurate bearings (primary tool)
- **Steering Compass:** Use if vessel aligned with bow/stern
- **Relative Bearings:** Can use ship's structure if compass unavailable
- **Frequency:** Every 1-2 minutes in potential risk situations

**Constant Bearing Indicators:**
- Other vessel appears stationary against background
- Bearing changes less than 5° while distance halves
- Vessel's aspect (viewed shape) doesn't change
- Relative position stays same on your vessel

**Method 2 - Radar Observation (In or Out of Sight)**

**Process:**
1. **Acquire Target:** Lock on approaching vessel on radar
2. **Plot Course:** Monitor target's plotted track
3. **Calculate CPA:** Closest Point of Approach distance
4. **Determine TCPA:** Time to Closest Point of Approach
5. **Assess Risk:** CPA < safe distance = Risk exists

**Radar Plotting Techniques:**
- **Manual Plotting:** Mark target positions on plotting sheet every 3-6 minutes
- **ARPA:** Automatic Radar Plotting Aid calculates CPA/TCPA
- **Trial Maneuver:** Test avoiding action before executing
- **Relative Motion:** Assess target's relative movement vector

**Method 3 - Auditory Detection (Restricted Visibility)**

**Process:**
1. **Listen for Sound Signals:** Identify signal pattern
2. **Determine Vessel Type:** From fog signal type
3. **Estimate Direction:** Use both ears or directional equipment
4. **Assess Distance:** Signal volume and clarity
5. **Calculate Risk:** Combine with radar if available

**Fog Signal Identification:**
- **1 Long Blast:** Power vessel underway making way
- **2 Long Blasts:** Power vessel stopped
- **1 Long + 2 Short:** Sail, RAM, NUC, Fishing, Towing
- **1 Long + 3 Short:** Last vessel in tow
- **4 Short:** Pilot vessel on duty
- **Rapid Bell:** Vessel at anchor
- **Bell 3-Stroke Pattern:** Vessel aground (3 + rapid + 3)

**Method 4 - AIS Monitoring**

**Process:**
1. **Check AIS Target:** Identify vessel name, type, course, speed
2. **Calculate CPA/TCPA:** Use electronic calculation
3. **Assess Intent:** May indicate destination or next waypoint
4. **Voice Contact:** Use VHF to confirm intentions if uncertain
5. **Backup:** Verify with visual/radar, don't rely solely on AIS

**AIS Limitations:**
- Not all vessels carry AIS
- Data may be incorrect or out of date
- Small vessels often don't have AIS
- Always verify with other means

### Stand-On Vessel Responsibilities (Rule 17)

**Primary Obligation - Rule 17(a):**
- **Maintain Course:** Hold current heading steady
- **Maintain Speed:** Do NOT alter speed (unless collision imminent)
- **Vigilance:** Continuously monitor give-way vessel
- **Even If:** Other vessel is larger, maintain course/speed

**Purpose of Standing On:**
- **Predictability:** Allows give-way vessel to plan its maneuver
- **Avoid Confusion:** Prevents both vessels maneuvering into each other
- **Systematic:** Part of structured collision avoidance system
- **Cooperative:** Relies on both vessels following rules

**When Action is Required - Rule 17(b):**

**Triggers:**
- Give-way vessel fails to take avoiding action
- Distance closing to unsafe range
- Constant bearing with decreasing distance
- Risk of collision becoming imminent
- Collision cannot be avoided by give-way vessel alone

**Required Action:**
- **Turn Away:** From the other vessel (not toward)
- **Starboard Turn:** Preferred (shows clear intent)
- **Stop:** Come to complete stop if necessary
- **Combination:** Turn and stop for maximum effect

**Last Resort Action Characteristics:**
- **Deliberate:** Clear, controlled maneuver
- **Obvious:** Shows clear intention to other vessel
- **Large:** Substantial course/speed change
- **Away:** Always turn away from other vessel
- **Timely:** Early enough to be effective (not last-second panic)

**Prohibited Stand-On Actions:**
- **Do NOT:** Turn to port for vessel on own port side
- **Do NOT:** Make small, hesitant alterations
- **Do NOT:** Accelerate when being overtaken
- **Do NOT:** Slow down prematurely (maintain speed until action required)
- **Do NOT:** Take action so early that give-way vessel is confused

### Safe Speed Determination (Rule 6)

**Factors to Consider:**

**State of Visibility:**
- **Restricted:** Reduce speed significantly
- **Fog/Rain:** Speed where you can stop in half visible distance
- **Night:** Consider reduced visual detection range

**Traffic Density:**
- **Congested Areas:** Speed allowing time to assess each vessel
- **Narrow Channels:** Speed allowing controlled maneuvering
- **Open Water:** Can increase speed with caution

**Maneuverability:**
- **Vessel Characteristics:** Turning circle, stopping distance
- **Draft:** Shallow draft allows closer inshore passage
- **Propulsion:** Single vs twin screw maneuverability
- **Current/Wind:** Effects on course keeping

**Background Lights:** Shore lights affecting vessel light identification

**Weather Conditions:**
- **Sea State:** Rough seas reduce maneuverability
- **Wind:** Strong winds affect course keeping
- **Current:** Tidal streams affect speed over ground

**Proximity to Navigational Hazards:** Rocks, shoals, wrecks, shallow water

**Radar Characteristics:** Range scale in use, detection limitations

### Risk Assessment Frequency

- **Open Ocean:** Every 15-30 minutes
- **Coastal Waters:** Every 5-10 minutes
- **Congested Waters:** Every 1-2 minutes
- **Narrow Channels:** Continuous monitoring
- **Restricted Visibility:** Continuous monitoring

### "If in Doubt" Principle (Rule 7)

**When Uncertainty Exists:**
- **Assume Risk:** Treat as risk of collision exists
- **Take Action:** Be proactive, not reactive
- **Reduce Speed:** Slow down to assess situation
- **Stop if Necessary:** Heave to or stop until situation clear

**Assessment Uncertainty Triggers:**
- Multiple vessels (hard to track all simultaneously)
- Poor visibility (can't see all vessels clearly)
- Erratic behavior (other vessel's intentions unclear)
- Equipment failure (radar/AIS intermittent)
- Fatigue (reduced ability to assess)

### Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) and Port Control

**When Available:**
- **Contact:** Seek information on vessel traffic
- **Report:** Your intentions and vessel details
- **Follow:** Instructions from authority
- **Comply:** Local traffic regulations

**Does NOT Relieve:**
- **Own Responsibility:** Master remains responsible for collision avoidance
- **IRPCS Compliance:** Still required unless local rule overrides
- **Watchkeeping:** Must maintain own watch

### Emergency Actions

**Last-Second Avoidance:**
- **Full Astern:** Reduce speed as quickly as possible
- **Hard to Starboard:** Turn away from vessel (preferred)
- **Sound Danger Signal:** 5+ short blasts
- **VHF:** Mayday call if collision imminent
- **Crew:** Prepare for impact if unavoidable

**After Near Miss:**
- **Log Entry:** Record all details
- **Review:** What went wrong in assessment
- **Report:** If required by regulations
- **Learn:** Adjust procedures for future

### Documentation Requirements

**Logbook Entries:**
- Time of first observation
- Bearing series and times
- Distance estimates (visual or radar)
- Actions taken and reasons
- Other vessel's actions (if observed)
- Weather/visibility conditions
- Names of crew on watch

**Witness Statements:**
- From crew members
- Other vessel if contact made
- Shore observers if applicable

### Assessment Recap

**Four Steps to Collision Avoidance:**
1. **Detect:** Use all available means (sight, sound, radar, AIS)
2. **Evaluate:** Determine if risk exists (bearing, distance, CPA)
3. **Decide:** Assign roles (give-way vs stand-on)
4. **Act:** Execute proper avoiding action or stand-on responsibilities

**Continuous Process:**
- Assessment must be continuous
- Reassess after each maneuver
- Monitor until vessels are past and clear
- Document all actions taken

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Taking bearings too infrequently to detect risk early
- Over-reliance on AIS without visual verification
- Stand-on vessel taking premature action
- Making last-minute alterations instead of bold action
- Forgetting to sound danger signal when appropriate
- Failing to log collision avoidance actions
- Not reducing speed sufficiently in restricted visibility
- Assuming give-way vessel will take action
