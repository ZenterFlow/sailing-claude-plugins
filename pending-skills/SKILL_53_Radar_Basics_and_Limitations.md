# SKILL: Radar Basics and Navigation Limitations

## Description
Understand radar operating principles, beam width limitations, and appropriate applications for navigation and collision avoidance.

## Prerequisites
- Basic navigation concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Explain radar detection principle (radio waves, time delay)
- Define beam width and its effect on target display
- Identify bearing discrimination issues at harbor entrances
- Distinguish when to prioritize range vs bearing
- Recognize radar-assisted collision risk

## Radar Principles
**Detection Method:**
- Transmits microwave radio pulses
- Measures time for echo return
- Calculates range: (time × speed of radio waves) ÷ 2
- Determines bearing from antenna direction

**Beam Width Effects:**
- **Definition:** Angular width of radar beam
- **Small targets:** Appear larger due to beam width
- **Gaps:** Harbors, entrances appear smaller than actual
- **Bearing discrimination:** Can't resolve small gaps until close
- **Result:** Harbor may only show when beam passes through entrance

**Range vs Bearing Priority:**
- **Range more accurate:** Sharp pulse timing
- **Bearing less accurate:** Beam width, antenna rotation precision
- **Navigation:** Prioritize range measurements
- **Collision avoidance:** Use both but weight range heavier

**Radar-Assisted Collisions:**
- Following radar without visual verification
- Making erratic course changes based on radar alone
- False sense of security (you see them ≠ they see you)
- Common cause: Misinterpretation, over-reliance

**Applications:**
- **Navigation:** Fix by ranges to charted objects, pilotage
- **Collision avoidance:** Detect vessels at long range
- **Weather:** Detect rain squalls, storm cells
- **Limitation:** Can't detect small objects (lobster pots, small boats without reflectors)

## Common Errors
- Trusting radar bearings more than ranges
- Assuming radar makes you visible to others
- Trying to identify harbor entrance from too far
- Not accounting for beam width distortion
- Radar-assisted collision through over-reliance

## Assessment
- Explain why range is more accurate than bearing
- Interpret beam width effect on harbor entrance display
- Identify radar-assisted collision scenario
- Determine when radar is more useful than visual
- Explain why radar doesn't guarantee detection by others
