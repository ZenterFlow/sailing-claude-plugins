# Test Prompts: Hand Bearing Compass Techniques

## Test 1: Basic Position Fix Request
**Prompt:** "How do I take a position fix using my hand bearing compass? I can see a lighthouse, a church tower, and a headland."

**Expected Output:**
- Object selection guidance (verify charted features)
- Bearing spread check (45-90° apart)
- Deviation minimization steps
- Sequential bearing technique (<2 minutes)
- Plotting instructions (reciprocal bearings)
- Cocked hat interpretation

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Stand away from metal (2m+ from engine)
- Take bearings quickly (within 2 minutes)
- Plot FROM objects seaward
- Bearings are magnetic (apply variation if needed)

## Test 2: Collision Avoidance Steady Bearing
**Prompt:** "A vessel is approaching. How do I use my hand bearing compass to check if we're on collision course?"

**Expected Output:**
- Steady bearing = collision risk principle
- Take initial bearing with time
- Wait 3-5 minutes
- Take second bearing
- Compare results:
  - Steady: collision risk, take action
  - Drawing aft: passing astern
  - Drawing forward: passing ahead
- COLREGS considerations

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Multiple bearings required (not just one)
- Maintain own course/speed during test
- Act early if bearing steady
- Make substantial, obvious alterations

---

## Test 3: Deviation Minimization
**Prompt:** "My hand bearing compass readings seem inconsistent. What could be causing this?"

**Expected Output:**
- Magnetic interference sources:
  - Engine, speakers, electronics
  - Metal tools, rigging, stanchions
  - Personal items (keys, phone)
- Proper technique:
  - Distance from metal
  - Level and steady hold
  - Consistent location
- **Critical:** No deviation table applies to hand-bearing compass

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Cannot be corrected like ship's compass
- Must minimize interference at source
- Technique and location critical
- Bearings always magnetic

## Test 4: Cocked Hat Interpretation
**Prompt:** "I plotted three bearings but they form a triangle about 0.3 NM across. Is this normal? What do I do?"

**Expected Output:**
- Small cocked hat (0.3 NM) is good/normal
- Vessel position within triangle
- Assume position at danger side (conservative)
- Typical accuracy ±0.25-0.5 NM
- Retake only if >0.5-1.0 NM

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Three lines rarely meet at exact point
- Small triangle indicates good fix
- Conservative positioning (danger side)
- Accuracy expectations realistic

---

## Test 5: Reciprocal Bearing Calculation
**Prompt:** "I took bearings of 045°, 130°, and 290° to three objects. How do I plot these on the chart?"

**Expected Output:**
- Calculate reciprocals (±180°):
  - 045° → 225° (from first object)
  - 130° → 310° (from second object)
  - 290° → 110° (from third object)
- Plot FROM each object seaward
- Position lines converge at vessel position
- Label each line with time and bearing

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Add 180° if bearing <180°
- Subtract 180° if bearing >180°
- Plot direction is FROM object
- All bearings are magnetic

---

## Test 6: Collision Risk with Bearing Change
**Prompt:** "Vessel bearing was 315° five minutes ago, now it's 320°. What does this mean?"

**Expected Output:**
- Bearing drawing aft (+5°)
- Vessel passing astern (behind you)
- Low immediate collision risk
- Continue monitoring
- No immediate maneuver needed
- May pass close, stay alert

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Bearing increase = drawing aft
- Safe passing astern
- Monitor but don't over-react
- Maintain course/speed

---

## Test 7: Object Selection Guidance
**Prompt:** "What makes a good object for hand bearing compass position fixing?"

**Expected Output:**
**Good objects:**
- Lighthouses (clear chart position)
- Church spires, towers (if charted)
- Prominent headlands
- Large isolated structures
- Unambiguous identification

**Poor objects:**
- Low features (hard to sight)
- Similar objects grouped together
- Partially obscured features
- Uncharted features
- Small/distant objects

**Bearing spread:**
- 2 objects: 60-90° apart
- 3 objects: 45-60° between each
- Avoid narrow angles (<30°)

---

## Test 8: Timing and Speed
**Prompt:** "How quickly should I take bearings for a position fix, and why does it matter?"

**Expected Output:**
- Target: Complete all bearings within 2 minutes
- Reason: Vessel keeps moving
- Longer time = vessel in different positions
- Result: Large cocked hat, inaccurate fix
- Technique: Identify objects first, then take bearings smoothly
- Practice efficient routine

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Sequential bearings take time
- Vessel movement during sequence
- Speed vs. accuracy balance
- Don't rush individual bearing, but complete sequence quickly

---

## Test 9: Magnetic vs True Bearings
**Prompt:** "Do I need to convert hand bearing compass readings to True bearings for plotting?"

**Expected Output:**
- Hand-bearing compass gives magnetic bearings
- **For chart plotting:** Use magnetic bearings directly
  - Modern charts have magnetic compass roses
  - Plot using magnetic rose
- **For calculations:** May need True bearings
  - Apply variation (from chart)
  - Magnetic ± Variation = True
- **No deviation table:** Hand-bearing compass only affected by variation

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Bearings are magnetic
- Variation applies (from chart)
- No deviation correction possible
- Usually plot magnetic directly

## Test 10: Integration with Collision Regulations
**Prompt:** "Bearing is steady at 045° and vessel approaching. I'm under sail, they're power. Who gives way?"

**Expected Output:**
- Steady bearing = collision risk confirmed
- Situation assessment:
  - You: sailing vessel
  - Them: power vessel
  - Generally: power gives way to sail
- **BUT:** Check if you're overtaking
  - If approaching from their stern quarter → you're overtaking → you give way
  - If crossing situation → power gives way
- **Action regardless:**
  - Don't assume they see you
  - Prepare to maneuver
  - Act early if they don't respond
  - Make intentions obvious
  - Safety over right-of-way

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Steady bearing = action needed
- COLREGS right-of-way rules
- Don't assume compliance
- Early, substantial action
- Safety paramount

## Test 11: Troubleshooting Poor Fix
**Prompt:** "My cocked hat is huge (over 1 NM). What went wrong and what should I do?"

**Expected Output:**
**Possible causes:**
- Poor object selection (narrow bearing spread)
- Bearings taken too slowly (vessel movement)
- Deviation interference (too close to metal)
- Poor bearing technique
- Object misidentification

**What to do:**
1. Check object identification (correct features?)
2. Check bearing spread (wide enough angles?)
3. Retake bearings:
   - Move away from metal
   - Take more quickly
   - Different objects if needed
4. Cross-check with DR position
5. If still poor: use alternative method (GPS)

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Large cocked hat indicates problem
- Systematic troubleshooting
- Don't use unreliable fix
- Alternative position methods
