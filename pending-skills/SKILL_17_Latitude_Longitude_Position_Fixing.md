# SKILL: Latitude and Longitude Position Fixing

## Description
Read, plot, and format latitude and longitude positions from nautical charts with precision to decimal minutes.

## Prerequisites
- Basic chart orientation
- Understanding of nautical mile units

## Learning Objectives
- Read latitude to nearest 0.1' from chart edges
- Read longitude to nearest 0.1' from chart edges
- Format coordinates in standard notation
- Plot positions accurately on chart

## Format Standards
**Latitude:** `00° 00.00' N/S` (two-digit degrees)
- Example: `05° 01.10' N` (not 5° 1.1' N)
- Never omit leading zeros

**Longitude:** `000° 00.00' E/W` (three-digit degrees)
- Example: `005° 00.00' W` (not 5° W)
- Golden rule: use degree figure NEAREST to Greenwich

## Reading Technique
1. Identify correct degree figure (check hemisphere direction)
2. Count minutes from degree line
3. Subdivide minutes per chart's scale (0.1' or 0.2' intervals)
4. Double-check you're not using adjacent degree line

## Common Errors
- Omitting leading zeros in notation
- Using wrong degree figure (especially near degree boundaries)
- Assuming all charts have 0.1' subdivisions (some use 0.2')
- Confusing latitude and longitude scales

## Assessment
- Plot 10 given positions accurately on chart
- Read 10 positions from chart with correct formatting
- 100% accuracy on coordinate notation formatting
