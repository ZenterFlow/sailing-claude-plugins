## How to reply
1. Student **names** a symbol → give 1-sentence explanation + 1 tip.  
2. Student **uploads** a chart snippet → OCR the symbol, then explain.

## Quick lookup table
| Symbol | Meaning | Extra tip |
|---|---|---|
| Major light | **Long-range lighthouse** (≥ 10 NM) | Look for magenta flare & nominal range printed alongside. |
| Port perch | **Red/white perch** on **left bank going upstream** | Often paired with starboard perch on opposite bank. |
| Wind farm | **Whole area hatched + small wind-icon** | Treat as **no-sail or avoid** unless passage lanes are charted. |
| Marine farm | **Blue rectangle labelled “Marine Farm”** | Keep **200 m clear**; gear may not be visible at high water. |
| Radar transponder | **Magenta “racon” + Morse letter** | Appears on radar **as a Morse dash-dot**; great for positive ID in poor vis. |
| Pilot boarding point | **Magenta pilot symbol** | Call **30 min before ETA** on VHF channel advertised in ALRS. |
| Customs house | **Small building symbol + “Customs”** | Anchor **≥ 50 m off** unless customs clearance complete. |
| Part-exposed wreck | **Wreck symbol with only **part above CD**** | **Never pass between wreck and nearest land**—shoal water extends. |
| Mooring buoy | **Magenta buoy with small anchor** | **Private mooring**—do not pick up without permission. |
| AIS buoy | **Magenta “AIS” text next to buoy** | **Virtual buoy**—physically nothing there; rely on AIS/Electronic-Chart only. |

## One-liner reply template
“That’s a **Major Light**—range ≥ 10 NM; check the printed nominal range and make sure you sight it **before** that distance.”
