# SKILL: Navigation Light Characteristics (SKILL_73)

## Description
Interpret and apply navigation light characteristics including flashing patterns, timing, and color codes to identify marks and determine safe passage at night.

## Prerequisites
- Lateral Marks Identification (SKILL_70)
- Cardinal Marks Navigation (SKILL_71)

## Learning Objectives
- Decode light characteristic abbreviations
- Calculate light sequence timing
- Distinguish between flashing, occulting, isophase
- Apply Morse code light signals
- Interpret group flashing patterns

**Light Timing Basics:**
- **Measurement:** Count from first flash of sequence to next first flash
- **Period:** Total time for one complete cycle
- **Visibility:** Lit buoys visible up to 2 miles; shapes/colors up to 1 mile

**Light Characteristic Types:**

**Flashing (Fl):**
- More dark than light
- **Examples:**
  - Fl.G3s: 1 green flash within 3 seconds
  - Fl(2)4s: 2 flashes within 4 seconds
  - Fl(2+1)G.5s: 2 flashes, pause, 1 flash within 5 seconds

**Quick Flashing (Q):**
- Very rapid flashes
- **Examples:**
  - Q: Continuous quick white light
  - Q(3)5s: 3 quick flashes within 5 seconds
  - Q(6)+long Fl1 10s: 6 quick flashes plus 1 long within 10 seconds
  - Q(9)10s: 9 quick flashes within 10 seconds

**Very Quick (VQ) / Ultra Quick (UQ):**
- Faster than quick flashing
- Used on cardinal marks
- Sequence numbers same as quick flashing

**Occulting (Oc):**
- More light than dark
- Light periods interrupted by short dark periods

**Isophase (Iso):**
- Equal light and dark periods
- **Example:** Iso.4s: 2 seconds light, 2 seconds dark

**Fixed (F):**
- On continuously without interruption

**Morse Code:**
- **Morse A:** One short and one long light period (dot-dash)

**Long Flash (LFl):**
- Single extended flash within period
- **Example:** LFl 10s: One long flash every 10 seconds

**Color Abbreviations:**
- **R:** Red
- **G:** Green
- **W:** White
- **Y:** Yellow
- **WRG:** White, red, green (sector lights)

**Group Flashing Patterns:**
- **Standard:** Fl(3)10s means 3 flashes then dark period totaling 10 seconds
- **Complex:** Fl(2+1) means 2 flashes, dark, then 1 flash within period
- **Cardinal Pattern:** 3-6-9 quick flashes for E-S-W

**Practical Timing:**
Use stopwatch or count rhythmically from first flash to next first flash to verify mark identity.

## Common Errors
- Miscounting flash sequences
- Confusing occulting with isophase
- Not timing full cycle period
- Misinterpreting group flashing (2+1) patterns
- Forgetting to verify color against expected mark type

## Assessment
- Decode abbreviation (e.g., "Fl(2+1)G.5s")
- Calculate timing and pattern from description
- Identify mark type from light sequence
- Verify mark identity using observed light pattern
- Match light characteristic to mark purpose
