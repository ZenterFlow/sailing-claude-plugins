# SKILL: Pilotage Planning Methods (SKILL_81)

## Description
Construct comprehensive pilotage plans using pictorial/sketch or rolling road methods, incorporating all critical navigation data for safe deck-level execution.

## Prerequisites
- Pilotage Fundamentals and Information Sources (SKILL_78)
- Clearing Bearings Technique (SKILL_80)

## Learning Objectives
- Gather all required information for pilotage planning
- Create pictorial/sketch pilotage plans
- Develop rolling road pilotage plans
- Apply variation and Height of Tide correctly
- Execute plans from cockpit without chart table reference

**Required Information Checklist**
Before creating any pilotage plan, research and compile:

**Tidal Data:**
- Heights of tide for entire period (hourly quick reference)
- Reference port tide tables for tidal streams
- State of tide at all times (know flow direction when possible)

**Port Information:**
- Entry limitations and restrictions
- Departure port details
- International port traffic signals used
- Communication channels and procedures

**Visual Navigation Aids:**
- Leading lights and transits
- Depth contours for safe corridors
- Buoyage positions and characteristics
- Useful charted marks (spires, towers, distinctive buildings)

**Route Details:**
- Hazards and obstruction locations
- Speed limits and local regulations
- Waypoints with verification methods
- Distances and estimated arrival times
- Overall passage time calculations

**Plan Creation Methods**

**Method 1 - Pictorial/Sketch Plan**
- **Format:** Bird's eye view drawing of area
- **Process:**
  1. Copy relevant chart section onto paper
  2. Add all buoys, marks, and hazards
  3. Mark compass courses between each leg
  4. Add bearings, distances, minimum depths
  5. Include visual confirmation points
- **Advantage:** Visual representation matches chart perspective
- **Deck Use:** Keep in plastic sleeve for wet conditions

**Method 2 - Rolling Road Plan**
- **Format:** Linear track from bottom to top of page
- **Process:**
  1. Draw single line representing vessel track
  2. Mark start point at bottom
  3. Work upward adding key information in sequence
  4. Include buoys, marks, hazards, courses, distances
  5. Add depth constraints and verification bearings
- **Variations:**
  - **Tram Lines:** Two parallel lines representing channel edges
  - **River Detail:** Add riverbanks, significant buildings, navigation points
- **Advantage:** Compact, pocket-sized, fits on small pad

**Standard Leg Format**
Each leg should specify:

**Leg 1 Example:**
- **Course:** 277°(M) magnetic heading
- **Distance:** 2.5 miles to next waypoint
- **Visual Verification:** Approach waypoint position confirmation
- **Minimum Depth:** 5m + Height of Tide
- **Maximum Depth:** 35m expected
- **Hazards:** None on this leg
- **Arrival Check:** When bearing to [object] is 230°(M) at expected depth 8m
- **Next Action:** Turn to new heading

**Essential Principles**
- **Research Benefits:** Drawing plan helps consolidate area knowledge
- **Memory Aid:** Process of creation aids recall of critical points
- **Navigation Station:** Proper place is cockpit, not below at chart table
- **Chart Protection:** Never take original charts, almanac, or pilot books on deck
- **Orientation:** Clearly mark whether plan is north-up or head-up

**Plan Continuity**
- **Mixed Navigation:** If trip includes offshore sections, plot occasional fixes on main chart when possible
- **Simple Fixes:** Use buoys, bearings, and depths for quick position updates
- **Logbook Entries:** Record key information at waypoints

**Emergency Procedures**
- **If Lost:** Stop boat near buoy/marker while re-establishing position
- **Doubt:** If uncertain at any time, stop vessel and fix position
- **Contingency:** Always include alternative routes in plan

## Common Errors
- Creating plans too complex to follow on deck
- Forgetting to include Height of Tide in depth calculations
- Not marking orientation (north-up vs head-up)
- Taking original charts on deck in wet conditions
- Failing to include visual confirmation points for waypoints
- Not researching tidal streams for passage timing

## Assessment
- Compile complete information checklist for sample harbor entry
- Create pictorial plan from chart extract
- Create rolling road plan for river passage
- Convert plan information to magnetic bearings where required
- Execute plan in simulation, staying on deck
