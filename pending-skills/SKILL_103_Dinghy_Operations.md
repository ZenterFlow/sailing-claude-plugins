# SKILL: Dinghy Operations and Transfer Safety (SKILL_103)

## Description
Execute safe dinghy operations including boarding, loading, engine management, and shore transfers while preventing the most common causes of boating accidents related to small boat misuse.

## Prerequisites
- Pre-Departure Safety Briefing and Equipment Verification (SKILL_098)
- Life Jacket Inspection, Maintenance, and Usage (SKILL_102)

## Learning Objectives
- Load and operate dinghy within safe capacity limits
- Manage engine and oar redundancy for propulsion failure
- Execute proper painter attachment and mooring techniques
- Apply alcohol prohibition rules strictly

**Dinghy Preparation and Loading:**

**Pre-Launch Checklist:**
1. **Life Jackets:** All occupants wearing correctly fitted jackets (mandatory)
2. **Oars:** Carry oars even with engine fitted (propulsion redundancy)
3. **Pump:** For inflatable dinghies, take manual pump
4. **Light:** Torch required for night operations
5. **VHF:** Consider handheld VHF for offshore trips
6. **Flares:** Pack mini flares for emergency signaling
7. **Engine Check:** Fuel, oil, and security of attachment

**Loading Procedure:**
1. **Even Distribution:** Load crew and kit evenly across thwarts
2. **Weight Limits:** DO NOT overload - risk of swamping
3. **Boarding Protocol:** Climb in and out carefully (one at a time)
4. **Secure Gear:** Stow equipment to prevent shift affecting trim
5. **Trim Adjustment:** Keep weight low and centered

**Engine Operation Safety:**
- **Test Start:** Confirm engine starts before casting off
- **Kill Cord:** Attach to operator's wrist or life jacket
- **Fuel Management:** Carry spare fuel in approved container
- **Propeller Awareness:** Keep painter length short to prevent prop entanglement

**Painter Management:**

**Attachment Requirements:**
- Tie painter to **bow ring only** (never to stern or side)
- **Length Limitation:** Must be short enough that it cannot reach propeller
- **Material:** Floating line preferred to prevent sinking into prop
- **Securing to Vessel:** Tie with quick-release knot to cleat or rail

**Mooring Considerations:**
- **Tidal Rise:** When tying to fixed jetty, allow sufficient slack for tide
- **Current Assessment:** In rivers, ensure current is not too strong for safe operation
- **Multiple Lines:** Use bow and stern lines to prevent swinging
- **Fender Placement:** Protect dinghy from chafe against vessel or dock

**Alcohol and Drug Prohibition:**
- **Zero Tolerance:** Do not operate dinghy under influence of alcohol or drugs
- **Celebration Risk:** Most common accident cause after shore leave celebrations
- **Legal Implication:** Many jurisdictions have same limits as road vehicles
- **Insurance Void:** Operation under influence typically invalidates insurance

**Operational Hazards:**

**Environmental Awareness:**
- **Current Strength:** Avoid operation if current exceeds dinghy's rowing capability
- **Wind Drift:** Small dinghies drift rapidly - allow for leeway
- **Wave Action:** Avoid lee shores where breaking waves can swamp dinghy
- **Traffic Areas:** Stay clear of shipping lanes and ferry routes

**Night Operations:**
- **Navigation Lights:** Display white torch or battery light
- **Speed Reduction:** Reduce to safe speed for visibility conditions
- **Radar Reflectors:** Consider small reflector for visibility to ships
- **Route Planning:** Follow well-lit shorelines when possible

**Emergency Procedures:**
- **Capsize:** Stay with dinghy, use it for flotation
- **Engine Failure:** Deploy oars immediately, signal with torch/flares
- **Swamping:** Bail with any available container, head for nearest shore
- **MOB from Dinghy:** Stop engine, throw flotation, recover using man overboard drill

## Common Errors
- Overloading dinghy beyond safe capacity
- Using painter long enough to reach propeller
- Failing to take oars as backup propulsion
- Operating after alcohol consumption
- Not allowing for tidal rise when tying to fixed dock
- Boarding overloaded with crew and gear simultaneously
- Attempting to cross strong river currents at perpendicular angle

## Assessment
- Load dinghy with 3 persons and gear demonstrating even weight distribution
- Tie painter with correct length limitation (cannot reach prop)
- Show proper boarding sequence for elderly or unsteady crew member
- Explain why alcohol prohibition is critical for dinghy safety
- Demonstrate quick-release knot for securing to vessel
- Assess river current strength and determine if safe to operate
- Execute engine failure drill transitioning to oar propulsion
