# Day Shapes and Vessel Identification

## Purpose
Identify vessel types and operational status from day shapes, interpret combined light/shape displays, and apply correct identification for collision avoidance under IRPCS Rules 20-31.

## Description
This skill covers all standard day shapes and their meanings, combined with night light displays. Essential for identifying vessel type, operational status, and determining right-of-way during daylight hours.

## Activation Triggers
Use this skill when you need to:
- Recognize standard day shapes and their meanings
- Identify vessel status from combined lights and shapes
- Distinguish fishing vessel types by day shapes
- Understand underwater operations obstruction markings
- Identify vessel distress signals
- Determine vessel operational status during daylight

## Behaviour

### Day Shapes Display Requirements

Day shapes must be displayed:
- **Daytime Hours:** Between sunrise and sunset
- **Restricted Visibility:** When in or near areas of restricted visibility during daylight

### Standard Day Shapes Reference

**Vessel at Anchor (Rule 30):**
- **Shape:** Black ball where best seen
- **Night:** Anchor lights

**Vessel Aground (Rule 30):**
- **Shape:** Three black balls in vertical line
- **Night:** Anchor lights plus two vertical red lights

**Not Under Command (NUC) (Rule 27):**
- **Shape:** Two black balls in vertical line
- **Night:** Two vertical red all-round lights
- **Meaning:** Severely restricted in ability to deviate from course

**Restricted in Ability to Manoeuvre (RAM) (Rule 27):**
- **Shape:** Ball-diamond-ball in vertical line
- **Night:** Red-white-red vertical all-round lights
- **Examples:** Underwater operations, dredging, cable laying, maintaining navigation aids

**Vessel Engaged in Underwater Operations (Rule 27):**
- **RAM Shapes:** Ball-diamond-ball vertical
- **Obstruction Marks:**
  - **Obstruction Side:** Two black balls vertical (two red lights at night)
  - **Clear Side:** Two diamonds vertical (two green lights at night)
- **Passing Instruction:** Pass on diamond/green side (clear side)

**Vessel Engaged in Fishing (Rule 26):**
- **Shape:** Two cones with apexes together, one above the other
- **Night:** Red over white (other fishing) or green over white (trawling)
- **Gear Warning:** If gear extends >150m, cone apex upward in direction of gear

**Vessel Engaged in Trawling (Rule 26):**
- **Shape:** Two cones with apexes together (same as other fishing)
- **Night:** Green over white vertical, plus masthead light abaft
- **Day Differentiation:** Requires careful observation of vessel activity

**Vessel Constrained by Draught (CBD) (Rule 28):**
- **Shape:** Cylinder (day shape only)
- **Night:** Three vertical red lights
- **Meaning:** Restricted to narrow channel by draft

**Vessel Towing (Rule 24):**
- **Length ≤200m:** RAM shapes (ball-diamond-ball)
- **Length >200m:** Additional diamond shape(s) to indicate length
- **Night:** Towing lights configuration

**Minesweeper (Rule 27):**
- **Shape:** Three balls in triangle shape
- **Night:** Three green lights in triangle shape
- **Meaning:** Engaged in minesweeping operations

**Diver Down Warning (Rule 27):**
- **Flag:** International Code Flag A (white and blue swallow-tailed)
- **Meaning:** Diver down, keep well clear and slow down
- **Night:** Appropriate lights for vessel type plus Morse A signal

**Motor Sailing Day Shape (Rule 25):**
- **Shape:** Cone apex pointing downward
- **Night:** Steaming light + sidelights + stern light (tricolour OFF)
- **Meaning:** Vessel is motor sailing (sailing vessel under power)
- **Size:** Proportionate to vessel size (clearly visible)

**Vessel in Distress:**
- **Shape:** Square flag with ball above or below (day distress signal)
- **Basket Shape:** Historical, rarely seen
- **Modern:** Use of distress signals (flares, flags, radio)

### Combined Display Interpretation

**Vessels Showing Making Way by Lights Alone:**
Only four types show making way status by lights:
1. **RAM:** Aspect lights + type lights = making way
2. **NUC:** Aspect lights + type lights = making way
3. **Fishing (other):** Aspect lights + red/white type lights = making way
4. **Trawling:** Aspect lights + green/white type lights = making way

**All Other Vessels:**
- **Underway:** Type lights only (no aspect lights)
- **Making Way:** No distinction in light display (must infer from context)
- **Example:** Power vessel shows same lights whether making way or drifting

### Fishing Vessel Specifics

**Other Fishing (Red over White):**
- **Day:** Two cones apex together
- **Night:** Red over white all-round vertical lights
- **Gear >150m:** Additional white light or cone apex in gear direction

**Trawling (Green over White):**
- **Day:** Two cones apex together (same as other fishing)
- **Night:** Green over white vertical, plus masthead light abaft
- **Masthead Light:** Positioned higher and abaft of green light

**Key Differentiation:**
- **Light Color:** Red vs green top light
- **Masthead Light:** Present on trawlers, absent on other fishing
- **Status:** Both are RAM when gear restricts maneuverability

### Vessel Distress Signals

**Day Signals:**
- Square flag with ball above or below
- Basket shape (historical)
- SOS by light/flag (Morse code)
- Continuous drum sounding

**Night Signals:**
- Red parachute flares, red hand flares
- SOS Morse code, continuous red light
- Flames (bucket of burning oil - traditional)

### Vessel Length Indicators from Lights

**Power Vessels:**
- **One Masthead Light:** Probably under 50m
- **Two Masthead Lights:** Probably over 50m
- **Visibility Ranges:** 2nm (small), 3nm (medium), 5-6nm (large)

**Sailing Vessels:**
- **Tricolour:** Under 20m
- **Red Over Green:** Under 20m (optional addition)

**Fishing Vessels:**
- **Trawler <50m:** Not required to show masthead light (but may)
- **Trawler ≥50m:** Required masthead light

### Special Cases

**Vessel <20m Sailing - Tricolour Use:**
- **Advantage:** Economical (one light instead of three)
- **Restriction:** Use ONLY when sailing (not motoring)
- **Prevention:** Prevents confusion with power vessel lights

**Vessel Motor Sailing - Cone Display:**
- **Day:** Cone apex down (visible to other vessels)
- **Night:** Steaming + sidelights + stern (tricolour OFF)
- **Fog:** Power vessel signal (1 long blast)

**Diver Down - Flag A:**
- **Requirement:** Rigid replica of International Code Flag A
- **Color:** White and blue swallow-tailed
- **Action:** Keep well clear and slow down

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Confusing fishing vessel types (red vs green top light)
- Forgetting towing vessels display RAM shapes plus towing lights
- Misidentifying vessel length from incomplete light display
- Not recognizing underwater operations obstruction markings
- Missing motor sailing cone during daytime
- Failing to display day shapes when required
- Passing on wrong side of underwater operations (pass on diamond/green side)

## Assessment Criteria

Competency demonstrated by:
- Identifying vessel type from combined light/shape display
- Determining if vessel is underway or making way from lights
- Distinguishing trawling from other fishing by light configuration
- Identifying safe passing side for underwater operations
- Recognizing vessel distress signals day and night
- Applying correct identification to collision avoidance decision
- Interpreting complete vessel status from all available indicators
