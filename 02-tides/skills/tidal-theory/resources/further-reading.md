## Key Concepts Reference

### Moon Phase Timeline
- **New Moon** → (1-2 days) → **Spring Tide** → (5-6 days) → **First Quarter** → (1-2 days) → **Neap Tide**
- → (5-6 days) → **Full Moon** → (1-2 days) → **Spring Tide** → (5-6 days) → **Last Quarter** → (1-2 days) → **Neap Tide**
- → (5-6 days) → **New Moon** (cycle repeats)

### Terminology Quick Reference
- **Syzygy**: Sun-Moon-Earth alignment (new/full moon) → Spring tides
- **Quadrature**: Sun-Moon at 90° (quarter moons) → Neap tides
- **Lunar day**: 24h 50min (time for Moon to return to same position over Earth)
- **Solar day**: 24h 00min (time for Sun to return to same position)
- **Perigee**: Moon closest to Earth → extra large tides
- **Apogee**: Moon farthest from Earth → smaller tides

### Geographic Variations

#### UK Notable Locations
- **Southampton**: Double high water (unique pattern)
- **Solent**: Complex tidal streams and stands
- **Poole Harbour**: Extended stand at HW
- **Portland Bill**: Strong tidal races
- **Pentland Firth**: Extreme tidal streams

#### Worldwide Examples
- **Bay of Fundy** (Canada): World's highest tidal range (16m)
- **Bristol Channel** (UK): Second highest (14m at Avonmouth)
- **Mediterranean**: Minimal tides (0.3m typical)
- **Gulf of Mexico**: Mostly diurnal patterns
- **Pacific Northwest**: Mixed semidiurnal

### Factors Affecting Tidal Range

1. **Astronomical**:
   - Spring vs neap cycle
   - Perigee vs apogee (Moon's distance)
   - Perihelion vs aphelion (Earth's distance from Sun)

2. **Geographic**:
   - Funnel-shaped bays (amplification)
   - Continental shelf width
   - Resonance effects
   - Local depth and topography

3. **Meteorological** (not covered in basic theory):
   - Atmospheric pressure
   - Wind setup
   - Storm surge

### Common Misconceptions

**Wrong**: Spring tides only occur in spring season
**Right**: Spring tides occur every 14 days year-round ("spring" means "to leap")

**Wrong**: High tide occurs when Moon is directly overhead
**Right**: High tide occurs 1-2 days AFTER lunar alignment due to water inertia

**Wrong**: Sun's bigger mass means stronger tidal effect
**Right**: Moon is 400× closer, and gravity decreases with distance², so Moon dominates

**Wrong**: All places have two equal tides per day
**Right**: Tidal patterns vary: semidiurnal (2 equal), diurnal (1 per day), or mixed (2 unequal)

**Wrong**: Tide times are the same each day
**Right**: Tide times advance ~50 minutes per day due to lunar day being 24h 50min

## Exam Preparation Tips

### Must-Know Facts
1. Spring tides = largest range, occur 1-2 days after new/full moon
2. Neap tides = smallest range, occur 1-2 days after quarter moons
3. Lunar day = 24h 50min → tides advance ~50 min/day
4. Two tidal bulges (near and far side) due to gravity + centrifugal force
5. Semidiurnal pattern (2 equal HW/LW) most common in UK

### Typical Exam Questions
- "When will spring tides occur if full moon is on 12th?"
  Answer: 13th-14th (add 1-2 days)

- "Why does far side of Earth have high tide?"
  Answer: Centrifugal force from Earth-Moon rotation

- "Identify tidal pattern from tide table"
  Answer: Count HWs/LWs and compare heights

- "HW today at 0800. When tomorrow?"
  Answer: ~0850 (add 50 minutes)

### Memory Aids
- **NEW or FULL → SPRING** (aligned = add forces)
- **QUARTER → NEAP** (90° = subtract forces)
- **Add 50 to get tomorrow** (50 min delay per day)
- **Two bumps, two dips** (2 HW, 2 LW in semidiurnal)
