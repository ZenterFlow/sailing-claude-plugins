## Purpose

Apply clearing bearings to maintain safe corridors between hazards, using hand bearing compass monitoring and tactical tacking to avoid dangers.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you ask about:
- Clearing bearings or danger bearings
- "Not more than" / "Not less than" (NMT/NLT)
- Safe corridor navigation
- Tacking at bearing limits
- Night clearing bearings with lights

## Behavior

### Concept and Purpose

**Clearing bearings** create a safe corridor between hazards by establishing bearing limits to a prominent object. The vessel stays between two plotted lines that are verified clear of all dangers.

### Plotting Clearing Bearings

**Step 1**: Identify Prominent Object
- Choose distinct, charted feature
- Church spire, summit, lighthouse, tower
- Visible from entire approach area
- Easily identifiable

**Step 2**: Draw Two Lines
- Create corridor boundaries from object
- Lines diverge outward toward vessel approach area
- Ensure safe water between lines

**Step 3**: Verify Safety
- Check entire area between lines is hazard-free
- No rocks, shoals, or obstructions in corridor
- Adequate depth throughout

**Step 4**: Label Bearing Limits
- **"Not MORE than [bearing]°"**: Maximum bearing limit
- **"Not LESS than [bearing]°"**: Minimum bearing limit
- Label both lines clearly on chart

**Step 5**: Convert to Magnetic
- Plot true bearings on chart
- Convert to magnetic for hand compass use
- Write magnetic bearings on pilotage plan

### Verification Check

**Before Using**:
- Use plotter to take bearing from hazard to object
- Confirm hazard bearing is outside (more/less than) clearing limits
- Double-check all bearings before relying on them

**Safety Margin**:
- Add buffer to account for vessel drift
- Consider tidal stream set
- Allow for helmsman error

### Monitoring Technique

**Hand Bearing Compass**:
- Primary tool for continuous monitoring
- Reads MAGNETIC only (no electronic compensation)
- Quick, direct reading

**Frequency**:
- Check bearing regularly as approaching danger area
- More frequent checks near limits
- Continuous awareness of trend

**Decision Point**:
- When bearing reaches limit, execute tack IMMEDIATELY
- Don't wait past limit
- Timely action prevents standing into danger

### Tacking Sequence

**Standard Procedure**:
1. Approach danger area on initial heading
2. Monitor bearing to prominent object continuously
3. **At "Not MORE than" limit**: Tack to starboard (turn away from limit)
4. **At "Not LESS than" limit**: Tack to port (turn away from limit)
5. Continue tacking between limits until clear of hazards

**Example**:
- **NMT 030°(M)**: When bearing reaches 030°, tack to starboard
- **NLT 350°(M)**: When bearing drops to 350°, tack to port
- Result: Vessel zigzags safely between rock groups

### Night Application

**Use Entrance Lights**:
- Port entrance light: One clearing bearing
- Starboard entrance light: Second clearing bearing
- Both lights create safe corridor

**Advantages**:
- Lights more visible than day objects
- Distance doesn't reduce visibility
- Clear identification by light characteristics

**Backup**:
- Monitor depth to confirm staying in safe corridor
- Cross-check with GPS position
- Use radar if available

### Single Clearing Bearing

**Use**: Keep vessel away from one side of channel or specific rock

**Method**: Maintain bearing on one side only
- Either "not less than" OR "not more than"
- Not both sides of corridor

**Example**: "Not more than 045°(M) keeps clear of rocks to starboard"

**Advantage**: Simple monitoring for single-side danger

### Depth Integration

**Safe Minimum Depth**:
- Additional check against standing into danger
- Always add Height of Tide (HOT)
- Set alarm on depth sounder if available

**Contour Following**:
- Use depth contours as secondary safety line
- Parallel to clearing bearing corridor
- Immediate warning if crossing into shallow water

**HOT Application**:
```
Safe Depth = Charted Depth + Height of Tide
```

### Example Scenario

**Harbor Entrance - Two Rock Groups**:
- Prominent object: Church spire ashore
- **NMT 030°(M)**: Clears rocks to starboard
- **NLT 350°(M)**: Clears rocks to port

**Execution**:
1. Approach on heading that keeps bearing between 350° and 030°
2. Monitor bearing continuously
3. At 030°, tack to port (away from starboard rocks)
4. Sail until bearing drops to 350°
5. At 350°, tack to starboard (away from port rocks)
6. Repeat tacks until through entrance
7. Monitor depth as backup throughout

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Reversing "not more than" and "not less than" labels on chart
❌ Using true bearings directly with hand bearing compass
❌ Waiting too long to tack after reaching bearing limit
❌ Plotting lines that allow hazards inside corridor
❌ Forgetting to add HOT when using depths for verification
❌ Not verifying safety of entire corridor before use
❌ Confusing clearing bearing with transit bearing (different purposes)

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Plot clearing bearings for harbor entrance with hazards both sides
- Convert true bearings to magnetic for hand compass use
- Determine correct tack direction from given bearing reading
- Execute safe passage using clearing bearings in exercise
- Create night clearing bearing plan using entrance lights
- Integrate depth monitoring with bearing limits

### Practical Application

**Scenario**: Clearing bearing NMT 045°(M), current bearing 042°(M)

1. **Status**: Within safe limit (042° < 045°)
2. **Action**: Continue current course
3. **Monitor**: Watch for bearing increase toward limit

**Scenario**: Clearing bearing NMT 045°(M), current bearing 046°(M)

1. **Status**: Exceeded safe limit (046° > 045°)
2. **Action**: Tack IMMEDIATELY to starboard
3. **Result**: Turn away from danger, bearing decreases

**Scenario**: Plot clearing bearings for narrow entrance

1. **Identify**: Church spire at 225°T true from entrance
2. **Hazard check**: Rocks at 218°T and 232°T from spire
3. **Safe corridor**: Between 218° and 232° is clear
4. **Variation**: 6°W → Magnetic bearings 212°M and 226°M
5. **Labels**: NLT 212°(M) and NMT 226°(M)
6. **Execution**: Keep bearing between 212° and 226°
