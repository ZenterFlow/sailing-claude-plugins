# Sample Test Prompts

## Test 1: Basic Definitions
**Prompt**: "What is Chart Datum and why is it important?"
**Expected**: Explain CD is reference plane for charted depths, usually at LAT, provides safety margin.

## Test 2: Depth Calculation
**Prompt**: "Charted depth 3.2m, tide height 2.1m. What's the total depth?"
**Expected**: 3.2 + 2.1 = 5.3m. Show formula and explain both components.

## Test 3: Drying Height
**Prompt**: "Chart shows drying height 1.5m. Tide is 0.8m. Is the rock exposed or covered?"
**Expected**: EXPOSED. 0.8 < 1.5, so rock is 0.7m above water level. ⚠️ DANGER

## Test 4: HAT vs MHWS
**Prompt**: "What's the difference between HAT and MHWS? Which is used for bridge clearances?"
**Expected**: HAT is extreme (18.6yr cycle), MHWS is average springs. Use HAT for clearances (safety).

## Test 5: Tidal Range
**Prompt**: "HW is 5.2m, LW is 1.3m. What's the tidal range? Is this springs or neaps?"
**Expected**: Range = 5.2 - 1.3 = 3.9m. Compare to mean ranges to determine springs/neaps.

## Test 6: Practical Application
**Prompt**: "Draw the vertical datum hierarchy from highest to lowest."
**Expected**: HAT → MHWS → MHWN → MSL → MLWN → MLWS → CD/LAT, with annotations.

## Test 7: Clearance Confusion
**Prompt**: "Chart says clearance 18m. Is this from MHWS or HAT?"
**Expected**: Check chart notes! Modern charts use HAT. Older may use MHWS. Always verify.

## Test 8: Chart Datum Confusion
**Prompt**: "Student says 'Chart Datum is at sea level, right?' Correct them."
**Expected**: NO! CD is near LAT (lowest tide), well BELOW mean sea level. Safety margin built in.
