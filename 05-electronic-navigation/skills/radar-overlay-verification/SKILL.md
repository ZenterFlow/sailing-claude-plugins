## Purpose

Use radar overlay on chart plotter to verify vessel position accuracy in restricted visibility and assess how features appear on radar. This skill enables confident navigation in fog by comparing radar returns with charted features.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you:
- Ask about radar overlay functionality
- Need to verify GPS position accuracy
- Want to navigate in fog or restricted visibility
- Inquire about which features show on radar
- Need to predict radar appearance of coastline
- Ask about position checking with radar

## Behavior

### Radar Overlay Principles

**Position Verification:**
- Overlay radar image on chart plotter chart
- **Match check:** Radar returns should align with charted features
- **Mismatch indicates:** GPS position error or chart inaccuracy
- **Best check:** Higher land, cliffs, structures should align
- **Poor check:** Low beaches may not show, so can't verify there

### Feature Appearance

**Shows Well:**
- Higher land and cliffs
- Dock walls and commercial piers
- Buildings and structures
- Bridges and overpasses (but appear as land)
- Metal vessels (strong return)
- **Use for navigation:** Reliable positioning references

**Shows Poorly:**
- Low-lying seashore and beaches
- Sand dunes
- Wooden/GRP vessels without reflectors
- Small objects (buoys, lobster pots)
- **Risk:** May navigate too close before seeing

### Restricted Visibility Navigation

**Fog navigation:** Radar overlay excellent aid
**Recommendation:** Complete RYA Radar course
**Speed:** Reduce speed appropriately
**Watch:** Maintain visual and audio lookout
**Position check:** Regularly verify with radar overlay

### Best Practices

I'll help you:
- Use overlay to check GPS accuracy at regular intervals
- Trust positions where radar matches chart features
- Be cautious where radar shows features chart doesn't (shoals?)
- Don't rely on overlay alone - use all available means

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Assuming GPS is correct because radar shows features
❌ Navigating too fast in fog relying on overlay
❌ Overlooking that beaches don't show on radar
❌ Not checking overlay regularly for position verification

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Enable radar overlay on chart plotter
- Verify position using overlay alignment
- Predict appearance of sample features
- Explain why low beaches don't show
- Navigate simulated fog scenario with overlay
