# Magnetic Interference Guide for Hand Bearing Compass

## Strong Interference (Stay >2m away)
- **Engine block** (strongest source)
- **Steering gear** (motors, hydraulics)
- **Large speakers** (magnets)
- **Electronics** (radar, chartplotter)
- **Steel tools** (spanners, hammers)
- **Wire rope** (jackstays, rigging)

## Medium Interference (Stay >1m away)
- **Winches** (metal components)
- **Stanchions** (if steel)
- **Canned food** (steel cans)
- **Batteries** (large banks)
- **Mobile phones** (when active)
- **Handheld VHF** (when transmitting)

## Weak Interference (Stay >0.5m away)
- **Aluminum fittings** (minimal)
- **Stainless steel** (less magnetic)
- **Watches** (minimal)

## Best Locations on Yacht
1. **Bow** (away from engine)
2. **Stern quarter** (away from engine, good visibility)
3. **Windward rail amidships** (away from cockpit electronics)

## Worst Locations
1. **Next to engine** (obvious)
2. **Cockpit near instruments** (chartplotter, radar display)
3. **Near speakers** (strong magnets)
4. **Steering pedestal** (steering motor interference)

## Testing for Interference
1. Take bearing of distant, fixed object
2. Rotate yourself 360° at same spot
3. Take bearing again
4. **Result**:
   - Same bearing (±2°): Good location ✓
   - Different bearing (>5°): Magnetic interference, move away ⚠️

## Rule of Thumb
**"If you can touch it, you're too close"**

Minimum safe distances:
- Engine: 2-3m
- Large electronics: 1-2m
- Metal fittings: 0.5-1m

## Compass Selection
- **Mini compass**: More portable, easier to hold at arm's length
- **Larger compass**: More stable, easier to read
- **Electronic compass**: No magnetic interference, but needs batteries

## Emergency Technique
If unable to get away from interference:
1. Take multiple bearings
2. Move to different locations
3. Average results
4. Treat fix as low-quality
5. Use GPS for verification

## Key Teaching Point
*"The hand bearing compass has no deviation table because it's portable - but that means YOU must stay away from sources of magnetic interference. When in doubt, move further away and test by rotating 360°."*
