## Spring and Neap Tidal Cycles

### Spring Tides (Maximum Range)
**Occur 1-2 days AFTER new moon and full moon**

```
    SUN ☀
     |
     |         EARTH 🌍 ← Moon pulls
     |            |
   (aligned)      |
                Moon 🌕 (Full Moon)

OR

    SUN ☀
     |
     |    Moon 🌑  EARTH 🌍
     |   (New Moon)  |
   (aligned)         |
```

**Result**: Sun and Moon gravitational forces ADD together
- **Maximum high water heights**
- **Minimum low water heights**
- **Largest tidal range**
- Occur approximately every 14 days (twice per lunar month)

### Neap Tides (Minimum Range)
**Occur 1-2 days AFTER first quarter and third quarter moons**

```
         SUN ☀
          |
          |
          |
    Moon 🌗 — EARTH 🌍
    (Last Quarter)

    (Sun-Moon at 90°)
```

**Result**: Sun and Moon gravitational forces PARTIALLY CANCEL
- **Moderate high water heights** (not as high)
- **Moderate low water heights** (not as low)
- **Smallest tidal range**
- Occur approximately every 14 days (twice per lunar month)

### Spring-Neap Cycle Timeline

```
Day 1:  New Moon 🌑
Day 2-3: SPRING TIDE ← ← ← (1-2 day lag)
Day 7:  First Quarter 🌓
Day 8-9: NEAP TIDE
Day 14: Full Moon 🌕
Day 15-16: SPRING TIDE ← ← ← (1-2 day lag)
Day 21: Last Quarter 🌗
Day 22-23: NEAP TIDE
Day 29: New Moon 🌑 (cycle repeats)
```

### Key Points for Passage Planning

1. **Timing lag**: Always add 1-2 days AFTER the moon phase
2. **Predictable**: Spring and neap tides alternate every ~7 days
3. **Check almanac**: Exact dates vary, always verify with tide tables
4. **Range matters**:
   - Spring tides = more water at HW, less at LW
   - Neap tides = moderate heights both HW and LW
5. **Spring ≠ Season**: "Spring" means "to leap" (larger range), not the season!

### Example Application
**Planning a passage over a shallow bar:**
- New moon on June 15th
- Spring tides expected June 16-17
- Best time to cross: June 16-17 at HIGH WATER (maximum depth)
- Avoid: June 16-17 at LOW WATER (minimum depth)
