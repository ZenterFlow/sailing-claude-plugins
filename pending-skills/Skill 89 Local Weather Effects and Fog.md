# SKILL: Local Weather Effects and Fog (SKILL_89)

## Description
Understand and predict local weather phenomena including sea breezes, katabatic/anabatic winds, and fog formation, with navigation strategies for reduced visibility.

## Prerequisites
- Cloud Types and Forecasting (SKILL_88)

## Learning Objectives
- Explain sea breeze formation and timing
- Identify katabatic and anabatic wind conditions
- Distinguish radiation fog from advection fog
- Navigate safely in fog using multiple techniques
- Apply wind-topography interactions

**Sea Breeze Formation**

**Conditions Required:**
- Clear skies with strong sun
- Temperature differential between land and sea
- Light ambient winds (or onshore wind enhances)

**Process:**
1. **Morning:** Sun rises, begins warming land
2. **Land Heating:** Land warms faster than sea (sea remains constant temperature)
3. **Air Warming:** Air above land warms and begins rising
4. **Pressure Drop:** Rising air creates local low pressure over land
5. **Sea Air Inflow:** Cooler, denser air from sea flows inland (sea breeze)
6. **Completion:** Rising air moves out over sea, cools, and descends, completing convection cycle
7. **Strength:** Typically Force 4 maximum without external factors

**Sea Breeze Enhancements:**
- **Onshore Ambient Wind:** Adds to sea breeze, increases strength
- **Offshore Ambient Wind:** Counteracts sea breeze, reduces near-shore wind
- **Sea State Benefit:** Inshore waters smoother due to short fetch

**Sea Breeze Limitations:**
- **Evening:** Land cools, convection slows, breeze stops
- **Rain:** Cumulus clouds may produce rain, killing sea breeze process
- **High Pressure:** Can reduce upward airflow, limiting formation

**Land Breeze (Reverse Process)**
- **Timing:** Nighttime when land cools
- **Direction:** Cool air flows downhill and offshore
- **Enhancement:** Steep mountainous coast increases effect
- **Strength:** Generally weaker than sea breeze

**Katabatic Winds**

**Formation:**
- **Location:** Coastal areas with high land/ice sheets
- **Process:** 
  1. Air cools at high elevation (ice sheets, snowy plateaus)
  2. Cool air becomes denser
  3. Density flows downhill due to gravity
  4. Air funnels through valleys and passes
  5. Accelerated by gravity
- **Timing:** Often at night or early morning
- **Conditions:** Usually occurs when no opposing headwind
- **Hazard:** Can be sudden, violent, and occur without warning
- **Local Names:** Known by regional names (e.g., Mistral, Bora)

**Anabatic Winds**

**Formation:**
- **Location:** Steep high land close to coast
- **Process:**
  1. Sun shines on steep mountain slope
  2. Air on slope heats and rises
  3. Creates low pressure on slope
  4. Draws in cooler air from sea
  5. Wind increases up hillside and onshore
- **Timing:** Calm weather, daytime
- **Result:** Often forms cumulus clouds above ridge top

**Fog Types and Navigation**

**Radiation Fog (Land Fog)**
- **Formation:** Land cools at night, cools air above it to dew point
- **Season:** Worse in winter months
- **Conditions:** Cold clear nights, little wind
- **Dispersal:** Sun warming land or air drifting over warm sea
- **Movement:** Can drift out to sea or down estuaries

**Advection Fog (Sea Fog)**
- **Formation:** Warm moist air passes over cold sea
- **Season:** Most common spring/summer (sea at lowest temperature)
- **Persistence:** Can last several days, unaffected by up to 15 knots wind
- **Thickening:** Daytime warming can make it thicker
- **Prediction:** Use wind direction and sea temperature
- **Trigger:** Mixing of saturated air masses (relative humidity 100%)

**Fog Navigation Procedures**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Life Jackets:** All crew don life jackets
2. **Position:** Establish estimated position by any means
3. **Lights:** Display proper navigation lights
4. **Sound Signals:** Comply with COLREGS fog signals
5. **Speed:** Reduce to safe speed for conditions
6. **Lookout:** Post additional lookouts, wake sleeping crew
7. **Radar:** Activate radar and radar reflector

**Navigation Technique:**
1. **Position Fix:** Obtain EP from last known position
2. **Contour Navigation:** Use depth sounder to find safe contours
3. **Buoy Location:** Use circle of error when approaching buoys
4. **Traffic Avoidance:** Head to shallower water away from shipping channels
5. **Shallow Water Strategy:** If near land without shipping concerns, head slightly deeper to reduce grounding risk

**Equipment Preparation:**
- **Dinghy/Life Raft:** Have ready for immediate use
- **Radar:** Experienced operator essential
- **Depth Sounder:** Continuous monitoring
- **Log:** Maintain position record, use with depth for contour tracking
- **Sound Signals:** Proper fog horn, bell, or whistle signals

**Wind Direction Fundamentals**

**Definition:** Wind direction indicates where wind COMES FROM
- **Northerly:** From north, blowing toward south
- **Southwesterly:** From southwest, blowing toward northeast

**Backing vs Veering:**
- **Backing:** Wind direction changes anticlockwise (e.g., NW → SW)
- **Veering:** Wind direction changes clockwise (e.g., NE → SE)

**Wind-Topography Interactions**

**Friction Effects:**
- **Process:** Moving air slowed by friction, reducing Coriolis effect
- **NH Result:** Wind slows and backs as it approaches land
- **SH Result:** Wind slows and veers
- **Navigation Use:** Plan route to use stronger winds (convergence) or avoid challenging conditions (divergence)

**Convergence and Divergence:**
- **Convergence Zone:** Wind flows together, stronger winds
  - Example: Wind astern, shore on starboard side (NH)
- **Divergence Zone:** Wind spreads apart, weaker winds
  - Example: Wind astern, shore on port side (NH)

**Onshore vs Offshore Winds**

**Onshore Winds:**
- **Direction:** Toward land
- **Hazard:** Lee shore conditions
- **Sea State:** Forces swell to shorten, creates breaking waves
- **Risk:** Vessel may not be able to sail away, risk of grounding
- **Rule:** "If in doubt, stay out!" - Stay offshore in strong onshore conditions

**Offshore Winds:**
- **Direction:** From land toward sea
- **Changes:** Backed more over land, veers and accelerates over sea
- **Navigation:** 
  - Starboard tack may be headed
  - Port tack may be freed (steady lift)
- **Hazard:** Can be fluky near cliffs, trees, buildings

## Common Errors
- Continuing normal speed in fog
- Failing to post additional lookouts in reduced visibility
- Misidentifying fog type and expected duration
- Underestimating katabatic wind hazards
- Not adjusting for sea breeze in passage timing
- Forgetting wind direction is "from" not "to"

## Assessment
- Predict sea breeze formation and strength
- Identify katabatic vs anabatic wind conditions
- Plan fog navigation strategy from given scenario
- Apply wind-topography effects to route selection
- Interpret wind direction terminology accurately
- Execute safe fog passage with proper procedures
