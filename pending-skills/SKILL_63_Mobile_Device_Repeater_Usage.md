# SKILL: Mobile Device Chart Plotter Repeaters

## Description
Use mobile devices (tablets/phones) as chart plotter repeaters, understanding advantages, disadvantages, and AIS data limitations.

## Prerequisites
- Chart plotter operation (SKILL_51)

## Learning Objectives
- Connect mobile device as plotter repeater
- Identify advantages (mobility, cockpit viewing)
- Recognize disadvantages (battery, screen visibility, alarm limitations)
- Distinguish between simple repeaters and full-function apps
- Understand AIS alarm limitations on mobile devices

## Repeater Types
**Simple Repeaters:**
- Display mirroring of main plotter screen
- Advantages:
  - View plotter from different location (cockpit/below)
  - Lower cost than second plotter
  - Wireless connection
- Disadvantages:
  - Battery life limited
  - Screen visibility poor in bright sunlight
  - **No AIS CPA/TCPA alarms**
  - Dependent on main plotter

**Full-Function Apps:**
- Independent display, not just mirroring
- Can show different screen than main plotter
- Often free app downloads from manufacturer
- May have limited functionality vs main unit
- Same connectivity and alarm limitations

**AIS Data on Mobile:**
- **Chart plotter AIS:** Real-time, direct VHF reception, full alarms
- **Internet AIS:** Delayed, shared data, no direct alarms
- **Mobile repeater:** Only shows what main plotter sends
- **Key limitation:** Most mobile repeaters lack CPA/TCPA audio alarms

**Use Cases:**
- Cockpit viewing when main unit below
- Backup display if main screen fails
- Different crew members viewing different data
- Not suitable as primary navigation device

## Common Errors
- Expecting full plotter functionality on mobile
- Not charging device, battery dies
- Using in bright sun without shade
- Assuming AIS alarms work on mobile

## Assessment
- Connect mobile device as repeater
- Identify 3 advantages and 3 disadvantages
- Explain why AIS alarms may not work on mobile
- Demonstrate viewing different screens (if app supports)
- Evaluate mobile vs dedicated second plotter decision
