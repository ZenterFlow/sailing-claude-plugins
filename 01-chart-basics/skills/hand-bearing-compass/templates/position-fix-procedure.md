# Hand Bearing Compass Position Fix Procedure

## Pre-Flight Checklist

### 1. Object Selection
Select 2-3 conspicuous charted objects:

**Good Choices:**
- ✓ Lighthouses (clear chart position)
- ✓ Church spires, towers (if charted)
- ✓ Prominent headlands
- ✓ Large isolated structures
- ✓ Radio/water towers (if charted)

**Poor Choices:**
- ✗ Low-lying features
- ✗ Groups of similar objects
- ✗ Partially obscured features
- ✗ Small/distant objects
- ✗ Uncharted features

**Bearing Spread:**
- 2 objects: 60-90° apart (ideal)
- 3 objects: 45-60° between each
- Avoid: <30° (poor crossing angle)
- One ahead/astern is acceptable

### 2. Minimize Deviation Sources
**Before taking bearings:**
- [ ] Stand 2m+ from engine/electronics
- [ ] Remove metal from pockets (keys, phone, tools)
- [ ] Check compass swings freely
- [ ] Move away from speakers, rigging, stanchions
- [ ] Use same location for all bearings if possible

## Taking Bearings

### Position Yourself
1. Find clear line of sight to all objects
2. Stand away from metal structure
3. Hold compass at eye height
4. Keep body relaxed but steady

### Bearing Sequence (Complete within 2 minutes)

**For each object:**
1. Identify object positively
2. Raise compass to eye level
3. Sight over compass at object
4. Level the compass (check bubble if fitted)
5. Let card settle (don't rush, but be efficient)
6. Read bearing to nearest degree
7. Record immediately with label

**Recording Format:**
```
Time: 1435 UTC
1. Lighthouse, Portland Bill: 045°(M)
2. Church spire, Abbotsbury: 120°(M)
3. Headland, White Nothe: 285°(M)
```

### Speed Tips
- Identify all objects BEFORE starting
- Move smoothly between sightings
- Don't overthink each reading
- Trust first settled reading
- Practice efficient routine

## Plotting the Fix

### Step 1: Convert to Reciprocal Bearings
Position lines are FROM object TOWARD you:

| Bearing TO Object | Reciprocal (±180°) | Line FROM Object |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 045°(M) | +180° = 225°(M) | 225°(M) |
| 120°(M) | +180° = 300°(M) | 300°(M) |
| 285°(M) | -180° = 105°(M) | 105°(M) |

**Rule:** If bearing >180°, subtract 180°. If <180°, add 180°.

### Step 2: Plot Position Lines
**For each object:**
1. Find object on chart
2. Place plotter/parallel rulers at object
3. Set course to reciprocal bearing
4. Draw line FROM object SEAWARD (toward your estimated position)
5. Label line: "1435 L/H 225°(M)" (time, object ID, bearing)

### Step 3: Interpret Intersection

**Perfect Cross (Rare):**
- Three lines meet at single point
- Unlikely in practice (measurement errors)
- If it happens: that's your position!

**Small Cocked Hat (Good Fix):**
```
        Line A
         /
        / X
       /  |\ Line B
      /   | \
         Line C
```
- Lines form small triangle
- Vessel position within triangle
- Typical: 0.1-0.5 NM across
- Accept middle of triangle as position

**Large Cocked Hat (Poor Fix):**
- Triangle >0.5 NM across
- Possible causes:
  - Poor object identification
  - Bearing taken too slowly
  - Deviation error (too close to metal)
  - Poor bearing technique
- Action: Retake bearings or use with caution

### Step 4: Safety Assessment
**Conservative Position:**
- Assume position at DANGER side of cocked hat
- If rocks to south, assume southern corner
- If shallow water to north, assume northern corner
- Better safe than aground!

## Accuracy Expectations

**Typical Performance:**
- Individual bearing: ±3-5°
- Position fix: ±0.25-0.5 NM
- Excellent conditions: ±0.2 NM
- Poor conditions: ±1.0 NM

**Factors Affecting Accuracy:**
- Vessel motion (calm vs rough)
- Distance to objects (near vs far)
- Bearing spread (good vs narrow)
- Operator experience
- Compass quality
- Deviation interference

## Quick Reference Card

```
POSITION FIX CHECKLIST
─────────────────────────────
□ Select 2-3 charted objects (45-90° spread)
□ Stand 2m+ from metal
□ Record time
□ Take bearings (<2 minutes total)
□ Record with labels (M)
□ Calculate reciprocals (±180°)
□ Plot lines FROM objects
□ Assess cocked hat size
□ Mark position at danger side
□ Note in log with time

REMEMBER:
• Bearings are MAGNETIC
• Apply variation for TRUE
• No deviation table applies
• Speed matters (vessel moving!)
• Label everything clearly
```

## Common Errors to Avoid

| Error | Effect | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Too close to metal | Deviated bearings | Move to clear area |
| Too slow | Large cocked hat | Complete in <2 min |
| Poor objects | Can't find on chart | Choose charted features |
| Wrong direction | Lines point wrong way | FROM object seaward |
| No labels | Confusion later | Label everything (M) |
| Forgot variation | Using Mag as True | Always convert if needed |

## When to Take Position Fixes

**Good Times:**
- Entering/leaving harbor
- Coastwise navigation
- Checking GPS position
- Dead reckoning validation
- Every 30-60 minutes on passage

**Essential Times:**
- GPS failure/doubt
- Approaching hazards
- Poor visibility developing
- Landfall after passage
- Confined waters navigation
