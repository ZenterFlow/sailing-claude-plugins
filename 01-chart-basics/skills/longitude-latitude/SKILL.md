### Latitude and Longitude
**Using The Latitude scale**

#### The Latitude Scale
This Latitude Scale is found on the left, and right hand edges of  navigation charts.

The Longitude Scale is found along the top, and bottom edges of the chart.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint your position on the earth just like a grid reference on a map.

To find our position north or south of The Equator we use latitude and to find out how far east or west we are we use longitude.

Latitude north is any angle between The Equator and the North Pole using the centre of the globe as a fulcrum.
Latitude south is any angle between The Equator and the South Pole using the same fulcrum.

Latitude lines go all the way around the globe, and run parallel to The Equator and are called 'parallels of latitude' or just 'parallels'.

In the northern hemisphere, latitude increases as you move north or up the chart from The Equator.

In the southern hemisphere, it increases as you move south or down the chart from The Equator.

The maximum latitude is 90° at the poles and the minimum 00° at The Equator.

The use of the nautical mile as a measurement reference is used as it relates to a rotational arc running the earth's core. The latitude breakdown is based on the distance of an arc, as it is very hard to determine distances on water based on traditional land-based measures for any significant distance, however, short distances of up to a few hundred metres are easy to approximate. By using nautical miles, it is easy to relate to the number of degrees travelled.
Distance
Each degree of latitude = 60 nautical miles

Each minute of latitude = 1 nautical mile

1/10th of a minute of latitude = 1 cable (as a unit of measure this is not really used any more but you may still see it )

1 Nautical mile = 1852 metres
The unit of metres and the nautical mile have a convenient correlation when it comes to speed. We shall look more at this later during tidal streams.

Some local forecasts and information may occasionally give marine distances using land measures. Be carefull!

Using The Latitude Scale
The Latitude Scale is used for measuring distance and in conjunction with longitude for establishing position.

Position
Latitude and longitude are read as degrees, minutes, and decimals of minutes.

When reading the degrees scale, make sure you get the correct figure for degrees. It is easy to assume that the degree figure nearest to where you are working is the correct one.

Double-check that you are not reading the next degree up (northern hemisphere) or the next degree down (southern  hemisphere).

Reading latitude

The Latitude Scale varies as you move north or south from The Equator.
This can lead to incorrect distance measurements if the same latitude is not used for both taking and checking the measurements.

See the animation to understand how to read degrees, minutes and decimals of a minute from the chart.

Divisions in the decimal scale
The divisions for minutes can vary from chart to chart so have a look at The Latitude Scale on the two RYA charts to see what the divisions within each minute are i.e. 0.1 or 0.2 of a nautical mile.

Format
The correct format for writing down latitude is 00°00.00' followed by N for north or S for south.

Using 00°00'.00 is also correct and both systems are used in the course.
If the latitude is, 5° 1'.1 it should be set out thus, 05° 01.10'.
