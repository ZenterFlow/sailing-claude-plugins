### Secondary Port Calculation (RYA Method)

**Step 1: Get Standard Port Data**
- HW time: {{HW_time}}
- HW height: {{HW_height}}
- LW time: {{LW_time}}
- LW height: {{LW_height}}

**Step 2: Apply Differences**
From almanac:
- Time diff HW: {{+/- min}}
- Height diff HW: {{+/- m}}
- Time diff LW: {{+/- min}}
- Height diff LW: {{+/- m}}

**Step 3: Calculate Secondary Port**
- HW time: {{HW_time}} ± {{diff}} = {{result}}
- HW height: {{HW_height}} ± {{diff}} = {{result}}
- Repeat for LW

**Step 4: Use curve or rule of twelfths**
