# SKILL: Feature Radar Appearance Assessment

## Description
Assess how distinctively different coastal features will appear on radar based on their composition, height, and location.

## Prerequisites
- Radar overlay verification (SKILL_64)

## Learning Objectives
- Predict radar return strength from feature characteristics
- Distinguish between strong, moderate, and poor radar targets
- Identify features that may not appear until close range
- Use feature assessment to plan radar navigation
- Recognize radar shadow areas

## Feature Assessment Criteria
**Strong Returns (Distinctive):**
- **Cliffs and high coastline:** Steep faces reflect well
- **Commercial docks/piers:** Vertical structures, metal
- **Large buildings:** Towns, industrial structures
- **Breakwaters and sea walls:** Solid construction
- **Metal vessels:** Strong reflectors (with reflectors)
- **Appear:** Clearly at good range, sharp edges

**Moderate Returns (Visible):**
- **Headlands:** Rounded but elevated
- **Hills sloping to sea:** Gradual but consistent return
- **Wooded coastline:** Some return from trees
- **Large buoys:** If fitted with reflectors
- **Appear:** Detectable but edges may be fuzzy

**Poor/No Returns (Non-distinctive):**
- **Low-lying coastline:** Beaches, sand dunes
- **Gentle sandy shores:** No vertical surface to reflect
- **Wooden/GRP vessels:** Without reflectors
- **Small buoys:** Below beam width detection
- **Appear:** May not show until very close or at all
- **Risk:** Navigation hazard if relied upon

**Radar Shadow:**
- **Behind high features:** Signal blocked
- **In lee of cliffs:** No coverage
- **Small bays:** May be hidden
- **Mitigation:** Use multiple features for positioning

**Practical Assessment:**
**Question approach for each feature:**
- What is the feature's height above sea level?
- Is it steep/vertical or gradual/sloping?
- What is it made of (rock, concrete, sand)?
- How far offshore are you assessing from?
- **Result:** Strong, moderate, poor, or no return expected

**Examples:**
- **Cliffs (Ores Chimneys):** Strong, distinctive
- **Headland (Taunton Point):** Moderate, visible
- **Commercial dock:** Strong, clear edges
- **Beach approach:** Poor, may not show
- **Bridges:** Strong, but appear as land

## Common Errors
- Expecting all coastline to show clearly
- Assuming harbor entrance visible from distance
- Not considering material composition
- Forgetting beam width affects small features

## Assessment
- Assess 8 features and predict radar appearance
- Explain why beach doesn't show on radar
- Identify best features for radar navigation
- Recognize radar shadow areas on chart
- Plan approach using radar-visible features only
