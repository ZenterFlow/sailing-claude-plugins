# SKILL: Radar Overlay for Position Verification

## Description
Use radar overlay on chart plotter to verify vessel position accuracy in restricted visibility and assess how features appear on radar.

## Prerequisites
- Radar basics (SKILL_53)
- Chart plotter operation (SKILL_51)

## Learning Objectives
- Enable radar overlay on chart plotter display
- Verify GPS position accuracy using overlay
- Predict how features appear on radar (coastline, headland, docks)
- Identify features that show poorly (low-lying land, beaches)
- Navigate using radar overlay in fog

## Radar Overlay Principles
**Position Verification:**
- Overlay radar image on chart plotter chart
- **Match check:** Radar returns should align with charted features
- **Mismatch indicates:** GPS position error or chart inaccuracy
- **Best check:** Higher land, cliffs, structures should align
- **Poor check:** Low beaches may not show, so can't verify there

**Feature Appearance:**
**Shows Well:**
- Higher land and cliffs
- Dock walls and commercial piers
- Buildings and structures
- Bridges and overpasses (but appear as land)
- Metal vessels (strong return)
- **Use for navigation:** Reliable positioning references

**Shows Poorly:**
- Low-lying seashore and beaches
- Sand dunes
- Wooden/GRP vessels without reflectors
- Small objects (buoys, lobster pots)
- **Risk:** May navigate too close before seeing

**Restricted Visibility Navigation:**
- **Fog navigation:** Radar overlay excellent aid
- **Recommendation:** Complete RYA Radar course
- **Speed:** Reduce speed appropriately
- **Watch:** Maintain visual and audio lookout
- **Position check:** Regularly verify with radar overlay

**Best Practices:**
- Use overlay to check GPS accuracy at regular intervals
- Trust positions where radar matches chart features
- Be cautious where radar shows features chart doesn't (shoals?)
- Don't rely on overlay alone - use all available means

## Common Errors
- Assuming GPS is correct because radar shows features
- Navigating too fast in fog relying on overlay
- Overlooking that beaches don't show on radar
- Not checking overlay regularly for position verification

## Assessment
- Enable radar overlay on chart plotter
- Verify position using overlay alignment
- Predict appearance of sample features
- Explain why low beaches don't show
- Navigate simulated fog scenario with overlay
