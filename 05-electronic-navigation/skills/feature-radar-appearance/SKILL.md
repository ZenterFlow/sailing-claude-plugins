## Purpose

Assess how distinctively different coastal features will appear on radar based on their composition, height, and location. This skill enables predictive radar navigation by understanding which features provide reliable positioning references.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you:
- Ask about how features appear on radar
- Need to predict radar return strength
- Want to identify good radar navigation targets
- Inquire about radar shadows
- Ask why certain features don't show on radar
- Need to plan radar-based navigation

## Behavior

### Feature Assessment Criteria

**Strong Returns (Distinctive):**
- **Cliffs and high coastline:** Steep faces reflect well
- **Commercial docks/piers:** Vertical structures, metal
- **Large buildings:** Towns, industrial structures
- **Breakwaters and sea walls:** Solid construction
- **Metal vessels:** Strong reflectors (with reflectors)
- **Appear:** Clearly at good range, sharp edges

**Moderate Returns (Visible):**
- **Headlands:** Rounded but elevated
- **Hills sloping to sea:** Gradual but consistent return
- **Wooded coastline:** Some return from trees
- **Large buoys:** If fitted with reflectors
- **Appear:** Detectable but edges may be fuzzy

**Poor/No Returns (Non-distinctive):**
- **Low-lying coastline:** Beaches, sand dunes
- **Gentle sandy shores:** No vertical surface to reflect
- **Wooden/GRP vessels:** Without reflectors
- **Small buoys:** Below beam width detection
- **Appear:** May not show until very close or at all
- **Risk:** Navigation hazard if relied upon

### Radar Shadow

**Behind high features:** Signal blocked
**In lee of cliffs:** No coverage
**Small bays:** May be hidden
**Mitigation:** Use multiple features for positioning

### Practical Assessment

**Question approach for each feature:**
- What is the feature's height above sea level?
- Is it steep/vertical or gradual/sloping?
- What is it made of (rock, concrete, sand)?
- How far offshore are you assessing from?
- **Result:** Strong, moderate, poor, or no return expected

### Examples I'll Help With

- **Cliffs (Ores Chimneys):** Strong, distinctive
- **Headland (Taunton Point):** Moderate, visible
- **Commercial dock:** Strong, clear edges
- **Beach approach:** Poor, may not show
- **Bridges:** Strong, but appear as land

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Expecting all coastline to show clearly
❌ Assuming harbor entrance visible from distance
❌ Not considering material composition
❌ Forgetting beam width affects small features

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Assess 8 features and predict radar appearance
- Explain why beach doesn't show on radar
- Identify best features for radar navigation
- Recognize radar shadow areas on chart
- Plan approach using radar-visible features only
