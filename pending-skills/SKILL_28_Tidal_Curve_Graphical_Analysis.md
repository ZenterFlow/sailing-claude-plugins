# SKILL: Tidal Curve Graphical Analysis

## Description
Use tidal curve graphs to find height of tide at any time and calculate rise/fall amounts for anchoring decisions.

## Prerequisites
- SKILL_27 (Tide Tables)

## Learning Objectives
- Plot HW/LW heights on tidal curve
- Determine height of tide at specific times
- Calculate tide rise/fall between times
- Compute anchoring depth for required clearance
- Distinguish spring vs neap curve lines

## Graphical Method
**Setup:**
1. Identify correct curve for your port (almanac page)
2. Fill -/+ hours along bottom (6h before/after HW)
3. Mark LW height on bottom axis, HW height on top axis
4. Draw straight line connecting LW to HW points
5. Identify spring (solid) vs neap (dashed) line

**Finding Height:**
1. Locate desired time on bottom axis
2. Draw vertical line to curve (use spring/neap as appropriate)
3. Draw horizontal to HW-LW height line
4. Project vertically to height scale at top
5. Read height above chart datum

**Calculating Rise/Fall:**
- Rise = HW height - current height (approaching HW)
- Fall = current height - LW height (after HW)
- Use to determine depth change for anchoring

**Anchoring Calculation:**
Required depth = Draught + Clearance + Fall to LW

Example:
- Draught 1.2m, clearance 1.0m, fall 2.7m
- Required depth = 1.2 + 1.0 + 2.7 = 4.9m

## Common Errors
- Using wrong curve (spring vs neap)
- Reading time from wrong side of HW
- Forgetting to use HW/LW heights for that specific day
- Not accounting for DST in curve plotting

## Assessment
- Plot curve and find height at 3 times with ±0.2m accuracy
- Calculate anchoring depth for given draught/clearance
- Determine rise/fall amounts between two times
