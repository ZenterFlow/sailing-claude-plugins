# SKILL: Radar Pilotage and Navigation Techniques

## Description
Use radar for navigation fixes, harbor entrance identification, and hazard avoidance while understanding beam width and bearing discrimination limitations.

## Prerequisites
- Radar basics (SKILL_53)
- Position fixing techniques

## Learning Objectives
- Obtain 3-point fix using radar ranges and EBL
- Identify harbor entrance using bearing discrimination
- Set clearing ranges for hazard avoidance
- Interpret beam width distortion on display
- Use parallel indexing for safe navigation

## Radar Fix Methods
**Range-Based Fix (Preferred):**
- Use VRM (Variable Range Marker) to measure distances
- Take ranges to 2-3 charted objects (lighthouse, headland, beacon)
- Plot ranges as arcs on chart
- Intersection = position (most accurate)

**EBL fix (Less Accurate):**
- Use Electronic Bearing Line for bearings
- **Beam width error:** ±2-5° typically
- **Bearing discrimination:** Can't resolve close targets
- Use only when ranges not available

**Harbor Entrance Identification:**
- **Problem:** Entrance narrower than beam width
- **Solution:** Approach until beam passes through
- **Sign:** Gap becomes visible only when close
- **Risk:** May be too close before seeing entrance
- **Mitigation:** Use ranges to entrance marks, not just visual gap

**Clearing Ranges:**
- Set maximum safe distance from hazard
- Example: Stay within 0.5 NM of lighthouse to avoid reef
- VRM set to safe distance, monitor continuously
- Alarm if range increases beyond limit

**Parallel Indexing:**
- Track parallel to coastline at set distance
- Draw reference line on screen or chart
- Maintain constant distance using range rings
- Useful for following coast or channel edge

**Beam Width Distortion:**
- Small buoys appear larger than actual
- Two close buoys may blend into one return
- Gaps appear smaller until close range
- **Rule:** Don't trust displayed size/shape

## Common Errors
- Relying on EBL bearings instead of ranges
- Assuming harbor entrance visible from distance
- Not accounting for beam width distortion
- Using radar as sole navigation method

## Assessment
- Plot radar range fix with ±0.3 NM accuracy
- Explain when harbor entrance becomes visible
- Set clearing range for hazard avoidance
- Interpret beam width distortion on sample display
- Demonstrate parallel indexing technique
