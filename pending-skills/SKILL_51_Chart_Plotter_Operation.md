# SKILL: Chart Plotter Operation and Configuration

## Description
Navigate chart plotter menus, configure display settings, set alarms, and interpret navigation data screens.

## Prerequisites
- Basic electronic chart knowledge (SKILL_50)

## Learning Objectives
- Access and interpret main menu pages (Navigation, AIS, MOB)
- Configure COG/HDG extension lines (time-based vs infinite)
- Set XTE and arrival alarms appropriately
- Use MOB function correctly
- Navigate between different display modes

## Core Functions
**Startup Warning:**
- Chart plotters show "aid to navigation" warning on startup
- Emphasizes: NOT primary navigation source, use paper charts
- Recreational charts not required to match official updates
- Must accept warning before use

**Menu Navigation:**
- **Hamburger menu (≡):** Access all functions
- Key pages: Navigation, AIS, MOB, Settings, Alarms
- Explore all options during familiarization

**Extension Lines:**
- **COG/HDG lines:** Show projected course/heading
- **Infinite:** Extends forever (can clutter screen)
- **Time-based:** Shows position after set time (e.g., 6 min, 12 min)
- **Advantage:** Predicts near-term position, clearer display
- **Input needed:** Speed (SOG) and heading for accurate projection

**Alarms Configuration:**
- **XTE alarm:** Triggers when off track beyond set distance
  - Consider: channel width, hazards, required safety margin
  - Typical: 0.2-0.5 miles for coastal, 0.1 miles for harbor
- **Arrival alarm:** Triggers when within set distance of waypoint
  - Consider: approach speed, reaction time needed
  - Typical: 0.1-0.2 miles for precise approaches

**MOB Function:**
- Dedicated button marks current position as MOB
- Automatically sets waypoint and may activate navigation back
- Critical to know location and operation method

## Common Errors
- Not exploring all menu options
- Setting alarms too tight (frequent false alarms)
- Leaving extension lines on infinite (screen clutter)
- Ignoring startup warning implications

## Assessment
- Demonstrate accessing Navigation, AIS, and MOB menus
- Configure 6-minute time-based extension line
- Set appropriate XTE alarm for given scenario
- Explain when to use arrival alarm vs MOB alarm
- Describe MOB button function and use
