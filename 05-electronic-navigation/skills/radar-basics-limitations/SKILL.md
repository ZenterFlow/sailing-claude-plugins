# SKILL: radar-basics-limitations
**RYA Yachtmaster – Radar Basics and Navigation Limitations**

## Purpose
Understand radar operating principles, beam width limitations, and appropriate applications for navigation and collision avoidance.

## Activation Triggers
- "how does radar work"
- "radar beam width"
- "radar accuracy"
- "radar-assisted collision"

## Behaviour
**Radar Detection Principle**:
- Transmits microwave radio pulses
- Measures time for echo return
- Calculates range: (time × speed of radio waves) ÷ 2
- Determines bearing from antenna direction

**Beam Width Effects**:
- **Definition**: Angular width of radar beam (typically 1-2°)
- **Small targets appear larger** due to beam width
- **Gaps appear smaller**: Harbor entrances may not show until close
- **Bearing discrimination**: Can't resolve close objects until near
- **Result**: Harbor may only appear when beam passes through entrance

**Range vs Bearing Accuracy**:
- **Range MORE accurate**: Sharp pulse timing, precise distance
- **Bearing LESS accurate**: Beam width, antenna rotation precision
- **Navigation priority**: Use range measurements primarily
- **Collision avoidance**: Weight range heavier than bearing

**Radar-Assisted Collisions**:
Common cause of accidents!
- Following radar without visual verification
- Erratic course changes based on radar alone
- False sense of security (you see them ≠ they see you)
- Misinterpretation and over-reliance

**Applications**:
- ✅ Navigation: Fix by ranges to charted objects
- ✅ Collision avoidance: Detect vessels at long range
- ✅ Weather: Detect rain squalls, storm cells
- ❌ Limitation: Can't detect small objects without reflectors

**Critical Teaching Point**:
"Radar is a navigation TOOL, not a substitute for seamanship and visual watch-keeping."
