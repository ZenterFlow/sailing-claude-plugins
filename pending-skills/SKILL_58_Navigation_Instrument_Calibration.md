# SKILL: Navigation Instrument Calibration and Accuracy

## Description
Calibrate log, depth sounder, and wind instruments to ensure accurate navigation data, and understand how to verify instrument readings.

## Prerequisites
- Log, depth, and wind instrument basics

## Learning Objectives
- Calibrate log using measured distance run
- Verify depth sounder using lead line or tidal gauge
- Check wind instruments against visual indicators
- Identify when calibration is needed
- Understand effects of inaccurate instruments on navigation

## Log Calibration
**Method:**
1. Find measured distance (charted distance between two points)
2. Run course at constant speed (preferably slack water)
3. Note log distance reading
4. Calculate correction factor
5. Program correction into instrument
6. **Reciprocal course:** Run opposite direction to average out tide/leeway
7. **Formula:** Actual distance ÷ Log reading = correction factor

**When to Calibrate:**
- New vessel or installation
- After impeller cleaning/replacement
- Periodically (annually or if readings seem off)
- After grounding or hull work near transducer

**Impact of Inaccurate Log:**
- DR/EP position errors accumulate
- TTG calculations wrong
- May arrive at hazard sooner than expected

## Depth Sounder Verification
**Methods:**
1. **Lead line:** Lower weighted line to seabed, compare to sounder
2. **Tidal gauge:** Check reading over known-depth sill at known tide
3. **Charted depth:** In calm water, compare to charted depth + tide

**Offset Settings:**
- **Keel reference:** Add draught to get total depth
- **Waterline reference:** Matches charted depth + tide
- **Transducer reference:** Nearest to raw measurement

**When Inaccurate:**
- Soft mud: reads deeper
- Bubbles: reads shallow
- Temperature layers: erratic
- &gt;100m deep: may fail

## Wind Instrument Check
**Apparent vs True Wind:**
- **Apparent wind:** What instrument reads (boat motion + true wind)
- **True wind:** Actual wind speed/direction
- **Calculation:** Requires boat speed (log) and heading (compass)

**Calibration:**
- Compare to masthead wind indicator (visual)
- Check in known wind conditions
- Verify after installation or repair

## Instrument Integration Effects
**Inaccurate Log → Wrong EP:**
- DR position based on log distance
- Error accumulates over time
- Circle of error becomes too large

**Inaccurate Depth → False Security:**
- May think deeper water than actual
- Grounding risk in marginal depths

**Inaccurate Wind → Poor Sail Trim:**
- True wind calculation wrong
- Routing decisions based on bad data

## Common Errors
- Never calibrating instruments
- Assuming factory calibration is correct
- Not checking after maintenance
- Ignoring consistent discrepancies

## Assessment
- Calibrate log using measured mile method
- Verify depth sounder offset with lead line
- Identify 3 symptoms of inaccurate log
- Explain why reciprocal course improves calibration
- Determine if depth reading is reliable in given conditions
