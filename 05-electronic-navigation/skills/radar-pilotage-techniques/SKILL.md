# SKILL: radar-pilotage-techniques
**RYA Yachtmaster – Radar Pilotage and Navigation Techniques**

## Purpose
Use radar for navigation fixes, harbor entrance identification, and hazard avoidance while understanding beam width and bearing discrimination limitations.

## Activation Triggers
- "radar fix"
- "radar navigation"
- "parallel indexing"
- "clearing range"

## Behaviour
**Radar Fix Methods**:

**Range-Based Fix** (PREFERRED - Most Accurate):
- Use VRM (Variable Range Marker) to measure distances
- Take ranges to 2-3 charted objects (lighthouse, headland, beacon)
- Plot ranges as arcs on chart
- Intersection = position
- **Accuracy**: Typically ±0.1-0.2 NM

**EBL Fix** (Less Accurate):
- Electronic Bearing Line for bearings
- ⚠️ Beam width error: ±2-5° typically
- ⚠️ Bearing discrimination: Can't resolve close targets
- Use only when ranges not available

**Harbor Entrance Identification**:
- **Problem**: Entrance narrower than beam width
- **Behavior**: Gap only visible when beam passes through
- **Risk**: May be too close before seeing entrance
- **Solution**: Use ranges to entrance marks, not just visual gap

**Clearing Ranges**:
- Set maximum safe distance from hazard
- Example: Stay within 0.5 NM of lighthouse to avoid reef
- VRM set to safe distance, monitor continuously
- Alarm if range exceeds limit

**Parallel Indexing**:
- Track parallel to coastline at set distance
- Draw reference line on screen or chart
- Maintain constant distance using range rings
- Useful for following coast or channel edge

**Beam Width Distortion Effects**:
- Small buoys appear larger than actual
- Two close buoys may blend into one return
- Gaps appear smaller until close range
- **Rule**: Don't trust displayed size/shape

**Critical Teaching Point**:
"Radar is excellent for RANGE. Use cautiously for BEARING. Prioritize range-based fixes."
