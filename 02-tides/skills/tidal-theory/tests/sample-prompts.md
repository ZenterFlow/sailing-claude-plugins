# Sample Test Prompts for Tidal Theory

## Basic Understanding
1. "Explain why we get two high tides per day"
2. "What's the difference between spring and neap tides?"
3. "Why do tide times advance 50 minutes each day?"

## Application Questions
4. "If there's a full moon on June 10th, when will the next spring tide occur?"
5. "Look at this tide table data - what tidal pattern is this? HW 0615 4.2m, LW 1230 1.8m, HW 1845 4.3m"
6. "Why is the Moon's influence on tides stronger than the Sun's, even though the Sun is much bigger?"

## Advanced Concepts
7. "Explain why the opposite side of Earth from the Moon experiences a high tide"
8. "A port has HW at 0830 today. What time will HW be tomorrow?"
9. "Which tidal pattern (diurnal, semidiurnal, or mixed) is most common in the UK?"
10. "If it's a first quarter moon today, when should I expect neap tides?"

## Passage Planning Scenarios
11. "I need to cross a shallow bar. The new moon is May 15th. What dates would give me maximum water depth at high tide?"
12. "Why might tide predictions be less accurate in the Solent or Poole Harbour?"
13. "Test me on spring and neap tide timing with moon phases"
