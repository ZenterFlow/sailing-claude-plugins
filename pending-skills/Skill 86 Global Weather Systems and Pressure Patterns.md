# SKILL: Global Weather Systems and Pressure Patterns (SKILL_86)

## Description
Understand global weather system formation, pressure patterns, and the fundamental principles driving atmospheric circulation including Coriolis effect and trade winds.

## Prerequisites
- Meteorology Fundamentals (SKILL_85)

## Learning Objectives
- Explain basic weather driving forces (convection, lapse rate)
- Identify high and low pressure system characteristics
- Apply Coriolis effect to wind patterns
- Interpret global pressure bands and wind patterns
- Distinguish between sea state and swell

**Basic Weather Principles**

**Atmospheric Convection:**
- **Heat Source:** Sun heats Earth's surface unevenly
- **Rising Air:** Hot air rises, creating low pressure at surface
- **Cooling Rate:** Lapse rate = 6.5°C per 1,000m as air rises
- **Falling Air:** Cool air descends, creating high pressure at surface
- **Moisture Capacity:** Warm air holds more water vapor than cool air
- **Condensation:** When air cools to dew point, water vapor condenses into clouds

**Pressure Systems**

**Low Pressure (Depression/Cyclone):**
- **Formation:** Rising air creates surface pressure drop
- **Airflow:** Air spirals inward and upward
- **Weather:** Associated with clouds, precipitation, stronger winds
- **Northern Hemisphere:** Anticlockwise circulation
- **Southern Hemisphere:** Clockwise circulation

**High Pressure (Anticyclone):**
- **Formation:** Descending air creates surface pressure increase
- **Airflow:** Air spirals outward and downward
- **Weather:** Typically light winds, settled conditions, clear skies
- **Northern Hemisphere:** Clockwise circulation
- **Southern Hemisphere:** Anticlockwise circulation
- **Blocking High:** Can disrupt low pressure movement
- **Squeeze Zone:** When pressed against low, creates strong winds

**Coriolis Effect**
- **Cause:** Earth's rotation deflects moving air
- **Maximum Effect:** At poles (greatest spin)
- **Minimum Effect:** At equator (weak spin)
- **NH Deflection:** Moving air deflected to right (east when moving away from equator, west when moving toward equator)
- **SH Deflection:** Opposite to NH

**Buys Ballot's Law**
- **Northern Hemisphere:** "Back to the blow, left to the low"
  - Stand with back to wind, low pressure is on your left
- **Southern Hemisphere:** "Back to the blow, right to the low"
  - Stand with back to wind, low pressure is on your right

**Pressure Gradient and Wind**
- **Isobars:** Lines of equal pressure (like contour lines)
- **Wind Strength:** Proportional to isobar spacing (closer = stronger)
- **Rule of Thumb:**
  - 6mb drop in 3 hours ≈ Force 6
  - 8mb drop in 3 hours ≈ Force 8
  - Sharp rise also brings strong winds
- **Geostrophic Wind:** Wind blowing along isobars (theoretical)
- **Surface Wind:** ~2/3 of geostrophic speed, backed 15° over sea

**Global Pressure Patterns**

**Equatorial Region:**
- **ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone):** Band of low pressure near equator
- **Doldrums:** 5°N to 5°S, known for light/variable winds
- **Trade Winds:** Result from pressure bands combined with Coriolis effect

**Pressure Bands (NH):**
1. Equatorial Low (ITCZ)
2. Subtropical High
3. Subpolar Low
4. Polar High

**Seasonal Movement:**
- Pressure bands follow sun's declination
- Move north in northern summer, south in southern summer
- Affects trade wind and doldrum positions

**Wind Direction Memory:**
- **NH Low:** Anticlockwise
- **NH High:** Clockwise
- **SH Low:** Clockwise
- **SH High:** Anticlockwise

**Sea State vs Swell**
- **Sea State:** Local wind-driven waves (rough/smooth)
- **Swell:** Distant-generated waves traveling into area
- **Combination Effects:**
  - Little swell + rough sea = exciting sailing
  - Smooth sea + 4m swell = usually manageable
  - Rough sea + 4m swell (especially breaking) = dangerous

## Common Errors
- Confusing NH and SH circulation directions
- Misapplying Buys Ballot's Law (left vs right)
- Using geostrophic wind speed directly instead of surface wind
- Overlooking pressure change rates as wind indicators
- Underestimating swell effects on sea conditions

## Assessment
- Predict wind direction around pressure systems in both hemispheres
- Apply Buys Ballot's Law to locate low pressure
- Estimate wind strength from pressure gradient
- Explain global pressure band formation
- Evaluate sea conditions from swell/sea state combination
