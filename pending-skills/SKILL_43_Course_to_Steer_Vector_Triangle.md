# SKILL: Course to Steer Vector Triangle Plotting

## Description
Plot the complete course to steer vector triangle including ground track, tidal vector, and water track to determine theTrue heading required to counteract tide and reach a destination.

## Prerequisites
- Tidal stream vector plotting (SKILL_31)
- Chart plotting fundamentals
- Speed/time/distance calculations

## Learning Objectives
- Construct CTS vector triangle in correct sequence
- Determine tidal hour and plot tidal vector from start point
- Use dividers to locate intercept point on ground track
- Measure True water track bearing (initial CTS)
- Calculate trip duration from ground track distance

## Plotting Sequence
**Ground Track:**
1. Plot start position (fix)
2. Plot destination/waypoint
3. Draw ground track line connecting them (extend beyond destination)

**Tidal Vector:**
1. Determine trip duration (to nearest 0.5 hour)
2. Identify correct tidal hour offset from HW (diamond or atlas)
3. Extract direction and rate for that hour
4. Plot tidal vector FROM START POINT (3 arrows)
5. Length = rate (knots) × time (hours)

**Water Track:**
1. Set dividers to boat speed (from latitude scale)
2. Place one point at end of tidal vector
3. Arc dividers to intersect ground track line = INTERCEPT
4. Draw water track line (single arrow) from tidal vector end to intercept

**Measurement:**
- Measure water track bearing with plotter = True CTS (pre-leeway)
- Measure ground track length ÷ boat speed = trip duration
- Verify tidal hour selection matches calculated duration

## Common Errors
- Plotting tidal vector from wrong point (not from start)
- Using wrong hour of tide for trip
- Not extending ground track to find intercept
- Forgetting tidal vector length = rate × time

## Assessment
- Plot complete CTS triangle in &lt;5 minutes
- Determine True CTS within ±2° accuracy
- Calculate trip duration ±5 minutes
- Verify intercept point within 0.5 NM precision
