# SKILL: Depth Sounder Configuration and Usage

## Description
Calibrate and configure depth sounder offset settings, understand accuracy limitations, and use depth for navigation verification.

## Prerequisites
- Tidal height calculations (SKILL_28)

## Learning Objectives
- Explain three offset calibration methods (keel, waterline, transducer)
- Set appropriate alarm for minimum depth
- Check accuracy using lead line or tidal gauge
- Identify factors affecting sounder accuracy
- Use depth to verify EP/GPS position

## Offset Methods
**Calibration Options:**
1. **From bottom of keel/max draft:**
   - **Advantage:** When reading = 0, vessel touches bottom
   - **Disadvantage:** Must add draught to get actual depth
   - **Best for:** Shallow water navigation, safety monitoring

2. **From waterline:**
   - **Advantage:** Reading matches charted depth (with tide)
   - **Disadvantage:** Calculation needed for keel clearance
   - **Best for:** Navigation using contours

3. **From transducer (no offset):**
   - **Advantage:** No artificial error introduced
   - **Disadvantage:** Must calculate both depth and clearance
   - **Best for:** Technical accuracy, troubleshooting

**Accuracy Verification:**
- Use lead line at known depth (sill, tidal gauge)
- Compare to sounder reading
- Adjust offset accordingly
- Check regularly, especially on new vessel

**Accuracy Limitations:**
- **Over soft mud:** Reads deeper (signal penetrates sediment)
- **Going astern:** Propeller wash affects signal
- **Large fish/shoals:** False readings
- **Crossing wakes:** Bubbles disrupt signal
- **Temperature layers:** Refraction errors
- **Deep water &gt;100m:** Signal dissipates, erroneous readings

**Navigation Use:**
- Calculate expected depth: Charted depth + tidal height
- Compare to sounder reading to verify position
- Set minimum depth alarm for each passage leg
- If depth &lt; expected, you're off track or in hazard

## Common Errors
- Not checking sounder accuracy regularly
- Forgetting to add tide height to charted depth
- Setting alarm too shallow for vessel draught
- Ignoring false readings in adverse conditions

## Assessment
- Choose appropriate offset method for given scenario
- Calculate expected depth for position verification
- Identify cause of false reading from description
- Demonstrate accuracy check with lead line
- Set minimum depth alarm for passage leg
