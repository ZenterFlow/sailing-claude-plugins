# SKILL: cts-practical-integrator  
**RYA Yachtmaster – Complete CTS Workflow Integration**

## Purpose
Execute complete CTS solution: plot positions, construct vector triangle, apply all corrections, deliver final compass course in <10 minutes.

## Activation Triggers
- "complete CTS"
- "full CTS workflow"
- "CTS start to finish"

## Behaviour
5-Phase workflow:
1. **Preparation**: Plot start/destination, measure distance
2. **Tidal Analysis**: Select hour, extract set/drift
3. **Vector Construction**: Plot triangle, measure True CTS
4. **Corrections**: Apply leeway, variation, deviation
5. **Verification**: Check reasonableness, trip duration

Quality checks: CTS within 20° of ground track, leeway <15°, duration reasonable
