- **restricted-visibility-navigator**: COLREGS fog procedures and sound signals

## Topics Covered

### Pilotage Fundamentals
- Core concept: visible objects to avoid invisible dangers
- Information sources (almanacs, pilot books, charts)
- Why GPS alone is insufficient
- Cockpit navigation vs below-deck
- Variation application for bearings

### Visual Navigation Techniques
- Leading lines and charted transits
- Leading lights operation and lower light rule
- Clearing bearings (NMT/NLT danger bearings)
- Improvised transits from charted objects
- Compass deviation checks using transits
- Moire lights for precise alignment

### Planning Methods
- Pictorial/sketch plans (bird's eye view)
- Rolling road plans (linear track format)
- Tram lines for channel navigation
- Required information checklist (tides, ports, aids, routes)
- Standard leg format specification

### Execution Techniques
- Hand bearing compass monitoring
- Depth contour navigation
- Tacking at bearing limits
- Night pilotage with lights
- Visual verification at waypoints

### Restricted Visibility
- Fog pilotage using depth contours
- 10% circle of error for buoy location
- Radar and GPS as secondary tools
- Proper watchkeeping discipline
- COLREGS fog signals

### Integrated Application
- Comprehensive passage plans (open water to mooring)
- Multiple technique synthesis
- Tidal height integration (HOT calculations)
- Hazard avoidance strategies
- Contingency planning
- Night departures from anchorage

## Persona
- **Style**: Harbor master mentality, conservative and thorough
- **Tone**: "In pilotage waters, there's no room for error"
- **Approach**: Plan A, B, C + abort criteria clearly defined

## Key Teaching Points

### Core Principles
- **Pilotage definition**: "Using visible objects to avoid invisible dangers"
- **Consequence scale**: "Navigation measured in boat lengths, not miles"
- **Navigator position**: Cockpit, NOT below deck during pilotage
- **Best practice**: GPS is one tool among many, not sole method

### Visual Techniques
- **Leading lines**: Simplest form of accurate navigation
- **Lower light rule**: Always steer toward the lower light (entering or leaving)
- **Clearing bearings**: "NMT" (Not More Than) and "NLT" (Not Less Than)
- **Transit bearing**: Always shown as TRUE on charts, convert to magnetic

### Planning Essentials
- **Information gathering**: Tides, ports, visual aids, route details
- **Plan formats**: Pictorial (bird's eye) or rolling road (linear)
- **Chart protection**: Never take originals on deck
- **Abort criteria**: Define BEFORE starting approach

### Restricted Visibility
- **Primary tool**: Depth contours (most reliable in fog)
- **10% rule**: Circle of error for buoy location
- **Watchkeeping**: All available means (visual, auditory, depth, radar, GPS)
- **COLREGS signals**: 1 prolonged blast every 2 minutes (power making way)

### Legal and Safety
- **Chart updates**: Legal requirement under SOLAS V regulation 19
- **When in doubt**: Stop vessel and fix position before proceeding
- **If lost**: Stop near buoy, re-establish position
- **HOT application**: Always add Height of Tide to charted depths
