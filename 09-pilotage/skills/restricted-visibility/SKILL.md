## Purpose

Execute safe pilotage in fog, rain, or reduced visibility using depth contours, radar, and GPS while maintaining proper watchkeeping discipline.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you ask about:
- Restricted visibility or fog pilotage
- Depth contour navigation
- Locating buoys in fog
- Radar and GPS use in poor visibility
- Watchkeeping in fog

## Behavior

### Reduced Visibility Challenges

- **Visibility Range**: May be limited to 0.5 nautical miles or less
- **Visual References**: Limited or no visible landmarks
- **Buoy Detection**: Cannot rely on sighting marks at normal distances
- **Depth Perception**: Even more critical than in clear conditions

### Depth Contour Navigation (Primary Technique)

**Concept**: Depth contours become your best friend in fog

**Method**:
- Follow contour lines that keep clear of all hazards
- Continuous depth sounder monitoring essential
- Always add Height of Tide (HOT) to charted depths
- Use depth to confirm staying on planned line

**Safe Corridor**:
- Choose contour that provides safe passage
- Verify entire contour line is hazard-free
- Monitor continuously for depth changes

**Example**: Follow 20m contour (+HOT) through foggy harbor approach

### Buoy Location Strategy

**When buoy is positioned on a depth contour:**

**10% Circle of Error Rule**:
1. **Approach Strategy**: Aim to one side of buoy's charted position
2. **Safety Margin**: Use 10% of travel distance as offset
3. **Contour Intercept**: Proceed to contour line where buoy should be
4. **Direction Decision**: When reaching contour, know which way to turn
5. **Search Pattern**: Follow contour toward charted buoy position

**Example**:
- Distance to buoy: 2.0 nautical miles
- Safety margin: 0.2 nm to one side
- Result: At contour, turn toward buoy knowing you're on safe side

### Radar Use in Pilotage

**Primary Role**: Secondary tool, NOT primary navigation method

**Requirements**:
- Experienced operator essential
- Skilled interpretation needed
- Cross-reference with GPS and depth

**Target Identification**:
- Buoys (if radar reflectors fitted)
- Headlands and coastline
- Other vessels
- Bridges and structures

**Limitations**:
- Cannot detect all hazards
- Rocks without radar signature invisible
- Shallow areas may not show
- Small buoys difficult to see

### GPS/Chartplotter Use

**Proper Role**:
- Position verification (confirms location)
- Track monitoring (ensures staying in safe corridors)
- Waypoint navigation support

**Limitations**:
- Gives position only, not hazard awareness
- Below-deck monitoring dangerous without external watch
- False sense of security if relied upon alone

**Best Practice**: Use GPS to confirm position, NOT as sole navigation method

### Proper Watchkeeping Discipline

**Skipper Position**: ON DECK with pilot plan and hand bearing compass

**Crew Assignment**:
- Experienced radar operator below if available
- Depth sounder monitor
- Forward lookout
- All crew alert and ready

**All Available Means**:
- Visual (limited but critical - watch for breaks in fog)
- Auditory (fog horns, bells, whistles from marks/vessels)
- Depth sounder (continuous monitoring)
- Radar (if available and operator experienced)
- GPS (position verification)

**Action Readiness**: Positioned to act quickly if hazard detected

### Hazard Detection Priorities

1. **Depth Sounder**: Immediate warning of shoaling (most important)
2. **Radar**: Surface objects, other vessels, aids to navigation
3. **GPS**: Position verification against plan
4. **Visual**: Any break in visibility, buoy sightings
5. **Auditory**: Signals from other vessels or navigation marks

### Communication

**Port Contact**:
- Use VHF to confirm conditions and traffic
- Request permission if required
- Get local knowledge if available

**Securité Calls**:
- Make position reports when appropriate
- Announce intentions in restricted waters
- Monitor emergency channels

**Channel Monitoring**:
- Listen for other vessel traffic
- Note any hazard reports
- Maintain proper watch on VHF

### Emergency Actions

**If Unsure**:
- Heave to or anchor in safe depth if possible
- Fix position using all available means
- Wait for visibility improvement if practical

**Sound Signals**:
- Comply with COLREGS fog signals
- 1 prolonged blast every 2 minutes (power vessel making way)
- 2 prolonged blasts every 2 minutes (power vessel underway not making way)
- 1 prolonged + 2 short every 2 minutes (sailing vessel)

**Position Fixing**:
- Use all available means before proceeding
- Confirm position with multiple methods
- Only continue when confident of location

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Attempting pilotage from below deck using only electronics
❌ Not assigning experienced radar operator in restricted visibility
❌ Forgetting to add Height of Tide to depth contour depths
❌ Relying on GPS alone without depth monitoring
❌ Failing to maintain proper fog signals
❌ Not using adequate safety margin (10%) when intercepting buoys
❌ Continuing when uncertain of position

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Create restricted visibility passage plan using depth contours
- Execute buoy location using contour intercept method
- Demonstrate proper watchkeeping station assignment
- Apply 10% circle of error for safe approach
- Respond to simulated depth shoaling in fog
- Integrate all available navigation tools properly

### Practical Application

**Scenario**: Locate buoy in fog, 3nm away, positioned on 15m contour

1. **Calculate offset**: 3nm × 10% = 0.3nm to starboard of buoy
2. **Approach**: Head toward offset position
3. **Depth watch**: Monitor for 15m + HOT contour
4. **Intercept**: When depth reaches 15m + HOT, turn to port
5. **Search**: Follow contour toward buoy position
6. **Confirmation**: Visual or radar contact with buoy

**Scenario**: Shoaling detected unexpectedly in fog

1. **Immediate action**: Alter course away from shallow water
2. **Position check**: Use GPS, radar, depth to fix position
3. **Assessment**: Determine error and correct course
4. **Verification**: Confirm new course is safe before proceeding
5. **Log**: Record incident and corrective action
