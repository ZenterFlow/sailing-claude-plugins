# SKILL: Electronic Navigation Limitations and Verification

## Description
Recognize limitations of electronic navigation systems, implement verification procedures, and maintain safe navigation when electronics are unreliable.

## Prerequisites
- All electronic navigation skills (48-55)

## Learning Objectives
- Identify when GPS accuracy is degraded
- Recognize radar beam width limitations
- Understand recreational chart quality issues
- Implement mandatory paper chart backup
- Navigate legally and safely with integrated systems

## Key Limitations
**GPS/GNSS Limitations:**
- Accuracy: 95% within 15m (5% of time worse)
- **HDOP &gt; 4-5:** Poor geometry, fix unreliable
- **Signal bounce:** Multipath error near structures
- **Waypoint entry:** Most common error source
- **Principle:** Only as good as data entered

**Recreational Chart Plotters:**
- Not required to meet official chart standards
- No guarantee latest updates incorporated
- **Startup warning states:** "Aid to navigation only"
- **Legal requirement:** Must carry paper charts
- **ENC limitation:** Not official ECDIS standard

**Radar Limitations:**
- **Beam width:** Small targets appear larger, gaps smaller
- **Bearing discrimination:** Harbor entrance may not show until close
- **False sense:** Seeing them ≠ they see you
- **Radar-assisted collisions:** Over-reliance on radar

**Depth Sounder Limitations:**
- Soft mud: Reads too deep
- Propeller wash (astern): False readings
- Air bubbles: Erroneous shallow readings
- Deep water &gt;100m: Signal dissipates

**AIS Limitations:**
- Only shows vessels with transmitting AIS
- Small craft may not have AIS
- CPA/TCPA unreliable during target maneuvers

**Mandatory Requirements:**
- Paper charts must be carried and used
- Paper passage plan required
- Position must be plotted on paper chart
- Electronics are aids, not primary means

## Verification Procedures
**Every Position Fix:**
- Plot on paper chart
- Check depth sounder matches expected
- If near charted objects, check radar ranges
- All systems should agree

**Regular Checks:**
- Log reading vs known distance (calibrate)
- Depth sounder vs lead line (verify offset)
- GPS vs visual/radar fix (verify position)
- Course steered vs COG (identify leeway/tide)

**When Electronics Disagree:**
- Trust paper chart and visual navigation
- Use depth contours as safety check
- Implement circle of error (DR/EP)
- Slow down until situation resolved

## Common Errors
- Using electronics as sole navigation method
- Ignoring startup warning implications
- Not plotting positions on paper chart
- Failing to verify waypoint entries
- Assuming recreational charts are official

## Assessment
- Explain why paper charts are legally required
- Identify 5 scenarios where electronics are unreliable
- Demonstrate verification procedure for GPS position
- Explain radar-assisted collision risk
- Respond to simulated electronics failure
