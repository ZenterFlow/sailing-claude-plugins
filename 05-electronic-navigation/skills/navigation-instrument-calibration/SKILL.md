**RYA Yachtmaster – Navigation Instrument Calibration**

## Purpose
Calibrate log, depth sounder, and wind instruments to ensure accurate navigation data, and understand how to verify instrument readings.

## Activation Triggers
- "log calibration"
- "depth sounder accuracy"
- "instrument calibration"
- "measured mile"

## Behaviour
**Log Calibration Method**:
1. Find measured distance (charted distance between two buoys/marks)
2. Run course at constant speed (slack water if possible)
3. Note log distance reading
4. Calculate correction factor: Actual distance ÷ Log reading
5. Program correction into instrument
6. **Reciprocal course**: Run opposite direction to average out tide/leeway
7. Repeat for accuracy

**When to Calibrate Log**:
- New vessel or installation
- After impeller cleaning/replacement
- Periodically (annually or if readings seem off)
- After grounding or hull work near transducer

**Impact of Inaccurate Log**:
- DR/EP position errors accumulate
- TTG calculations wrong
- May arrive at hazard sooner than expected

**Depth Sounder Verification Methods**:
1. **Lead line**: Lower weighted line to seabed, compare to sounder
2. **Tidal gauge**: Check over known-depth sill at known tide
3. **Charted depth**: In calm water, compare to charted depth + tide

**Offset Settings**:
- Keel reference: Add draught to get total depth
- Waterline reference: Matches charted depth + tide
- Transducer reference: Nearest to raw measurement

**Wind Instrument Check**:
- **Apparent wind**: What instrument reads (boat motion + true wind)
- **True wind**: Actual wind (requires boat speed + heading)
- Compare to masthead indicator (visual check)
- Verify after installation or repair

**Instrument Integration Effects**:
- Inaccurate log → Wrong EP (error accumulates)
- Inaccurate depth → False security (grounding risk)
- Inaccurate wind → Poor sail trim decisions

**Critical Teaching Point**:
"Factory calibration is a starting point, not a guarantee. Verify on YOUR vessel."
