# SKILL: Restricted Visibility Navigation and Radar Reflector Deployment (SKILL_107)

## Description
Navigate safely when caught in fog or restricted visibility by applying systematic procedures, deploying radar reflectors correctly, and using all available means to detect and avoid other vessels while maintaining safe speed.

## Prerequisites
- Pre-Departure Safety Briefing and Equipment Verification (SKILL_098)

## Learning Objectives
- Implement fog navigation procedures from position establishment to diversion decision
- Deploy radar reflectors for maximum effectiveness based on vessel construction
- Apply safe speed determination factors for restricted visibility
- Coordinate visual, radar, and auditory detection methods

**Fog Encounter Procedures:**

**Immediate Actions (Within First 2 Minutes):**
1. **Establish Position:** Fix position on chart with GPS lat/long
2. **Don Life Jackets:** All crew put on life jackets immediately
3. **Deploy Radar Reflector:** If not already rigged, deploy immediately
4. **Navigation Lights:** Turn on (steaming light, bow lights, stern light)
5. **Reduce Speed:** Slow to safe speed where you can stop in half visible distance
6. **Sound Fog Signals:** Appropriate signal for vessel type and motion

**Crew and Equipment Readiness:**
7. **Extra Lookouts:** Post additional crew to watch for lights/sounds
8. **Engine Readiness:** Consider starting engine for maneuverability even if under sail
9. **Missed Vessel Preparation:** Wake crew in fore cabin (collision risk highest forward)
10. **Dinghy/Life Raft:** Have ready for immediate launch if collision imminent
11. **White Flare:** Keep handheld white flare ready for close-quarters warning

**Navigation and Detection:**
12. **Instrument Use:** GPS, echo sounder, VHF all used to full capability
13. **Radar Operation:** If fitted, use properly to detect other vessels
14. **VHF Monitoring:** Listen for fog signals and vessel traffic reports
15. **Depth Sounding:** Monitor depth to stay in safe water and detect shallowing

**Diversion Decision Factors:**
- **Safe Anchorage Available:** If nearby anchorage known, consider waiting out fog
- **Shallow Water Option:** Making for shallow water may put you clear of shipping
- **Traffic Density:** In heavy traffic areas, anchoring may be safer than proceeding
- **Duration:** If forecast shows fog clearing in 1-2 hours, waiting may be prudent
- **Crew Fatigue:** Long fog transit is extremely fatiguing - consider rest

**Safe Speed Determination (Rule 6 Applied to Fog):**

**Visual Range Method:**
- Speed where you can stop vessel within half the distance of visible horizon
- Example: If visibility 50m, speed should allow stop within 25m
- Consider vessel's displacement and reverse thrust capability

**Traffic Density Adjustment:**
- **High Density:** Reduce speed further to assess each vessel
- **Open Water:** Can maintain moderate speed with radar/AIS
- **Narrow Channels:** Bare steerageway only

**Environmental Factors:**
- **Background Lights:** Shore lights obscure vessel lights - reduce speed
- **Sea State:** Rough seas reduce maneuverability - slower speed
- **Current:** Strong current reduces effective control - compensate with speed reduction

**Radar Reflector Deployment:**

**Reflector Types and Effectiveness:**

**Fixed Reflector:**
- **Design:** Solid plastic/metal construction, permanently mounted high on mast
- **Advantage:** Always deployed, no action required in emergency
- **Performance:** Superior to collapsible - always working at full efficiency
- **Placement:** As high as practicable on mast (above 4m if possible)

**Collapsible Reflector:**
- **Design:** Folds flat for storage, opens to octahedral shape
- **Advantage:** Lower cost, removable when not needed
- **Disadvantage:** Must be deployed manually, may be forgotten
- **Performance:** Good but less effective than fixed equivalent size

**Material-Specific Requirements:**
- **GRP/Wood/Carbon Fiber:** DO NOT reflect radar waves - MUST have radar reflector
- **Steel Hulls:** Do reflect radar but deployment recommended for extra security
- **Hull Reflection Issue:** Steel can reflect waves in wrong direction, reflector designed to return to sender

**Mounting for Maximum Effectiveness:**
- **Height:** As large as possible and fitted as high as possible
- **Orientation:** Ensure reflector can rotate freely to present all angles
- **Avoid Obstruction:** Keep clear of masthead instruments that could shadow
- **Stability:** On motor vessels, mount on radar arch or mast, not on moving parts

**Reflector Sizing Guidelines:**
- **Under 10m:** Minimum 2m² RCS (Radar Cross Section)
- **10-15m:** Minimum 3.75m² RCS
- **Over 15m:** Minimum 7.5m² RCS (or two smaller reflectors)

**Radar Operation in Fog:**

**Target Acquisition:**
- **Range Scale:** Start with 3-mile range, adjust as needed
- **Gain Setting:** Tune to show weak targets without excessive clutter
- **Sea Clutter:** Reduce to filter wave returns but not small vessels
- **Rain Clutter:** Use as needed in precipitation

**Target Assessment:**
- **Plotting:** Use ARPA or manual plotting to determine CPA/TCPA
- **Closest Point of Approach:** Any target with CPA &lt; 0.5nm requires monitoring
- **Time to CPA:** TCPA &lt; 10 minutes = immediate action required
- **Course Changes:** If target's relative bearing stays constant = risk of collision

**Limitations in Fog:**
- **Small Vessels:** May not appear on radar until very close (within 1-2nm)
- **Wood/GRP:** Poor radar reflectors may be invisible
- **Sea Clutter:** Waves hide small targets, especially within 0.5nm
- **Interpretation:** Cannot determine vessel type (yacht vs power) from radar alone

**Auditory Detection Backup:**
- **Listen for Fog Signals:** 1 long blast (power), 1 long + 2 short (sailing/RAM)
- **Estimate Direction:** Face into wind, sound may be downwind
- **Distance Judgment:** Loudness decreases with distance but difficult to quantify
- **Engine Sounds:** Many vessels run engine in fog even if sailing

**Sound Signal Requirements (Rules 35):**

**Power-Driven Vessel Underway:**
- **Making Way:** 1 prolonged blast (4-6 seconds) every 2 minutes
- **Stopped:** 2 prolonged blasts every 2 minutes

**Sailing Vessel Underway:**
- **All Conditions:** 1 prolonged + 2 short blasts every 2 minutes

**Vessel at Anchor:**
- **Rapid Bell:** 5 seconds rapid ringing of bell forward
- **Gong:** May be supplemented with gong astern

**Vessel Aground:**
- **Bell + Gong:** 3 distinct strokes on bell before and after rapid bell

## Common Errors
- Forgetting to deploy radar reflector (especially GRP/wooden vessels)
- Not reducing speed sufficiently for visibility conditions
- Failing to post extra lookouts relying only on radar
- Using wrong fog signal for vessel type/motion
- Opening hatches for ventilation before checking for nearby vessel sounds
- Anchoring in shipping channel because "it's foggy"
- Not waking off-watch crew, creating single-point-of-failure

## Assessment
- Demonstrate immediate fog actions sequence within 3 minutes
- Deploy radar reflector and explain why GRP vessels require it
- Make appropriate fog signal for sailing vessel underway
- Calculate safe speed based on 30m visibility and vessel stopping distance
- Interpret radar screen showing target with constant bearing and decreasing range
- Explain why you cannot rely on "yacht has right of way over power" in fog
- Show VHF Channel 16 monitoring while simultaneously operating radar
