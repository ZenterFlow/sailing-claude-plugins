# Sample Test Prompts

## Test 1: Basic Cause
**Prompt**: "Why do tides happen?"
**Expected**: Moon's gravity creates bulge, centrifugal force creates opposite bulge. Earth rotates through both = 2 tides/day.

## Test 2: Spring Tides
**Prompt**: "What are spring tides and when do they occur?"
**Expected**: Larger range, occur at new/full moon when Sun-Earth-Moon aligned. Forces add. Lag 1-2 days.

## Test 3: Neap Tides
**Prompt**: "Explain neap tides."
**Expected**: Smaller range, occur at quarter moons when Sun-Moon at 90°. Forces partially cancel. Lag 1-2 days.

## Test 4: Lunar Day
**Prompt**: "Why don't tides happen at the same time every day?"
**Expected**: Lunar day = 24h 50min. Moon rises ~50 min later daily. Tides follow Moon. So tides advance ~50 min/day.

## Test 5: Tidal Patterns
**Prompt**: "What's the difference between semidiurnal and diurnal tides?"
**Expected**: Semidiurnal = 2 HW/LW daily (equal heights). Diurnal = 1 HW/LW daily. Most places semidiurnal.

## Test 6: Spring Misconception
**Prompt**: "Student says 'Spring tides happen in spring season'. Correct them."
**Expected**: NO! Spring = "spring forth" (larger). Happen at new/full moon year-round, not seasonal.

## Test 7: Sun's Role
**Prompt**: "If the Moon causes tides, what does the Sun do?"
**Expected**: Sun contributes ~46% of tidal force. Adds to Moon's pull (springs) or subtracts (neaps).

## Test 8: Practical Application
**Prompt**: "Today's HW is 1015. When will HW be tomorrow, approximately?"
**Expected**: Add ~50 minutes: ~1105 tomorrow. Quick estimate without tables!

## Test 9: Age of Tide
**Prompt**: "Why don't springs happen exactly on the full moon?"
**Expected**: Ocean "sloshes" - takes 1-2 days to respond. This lag is called "age of tide".

## Test 10: Two Bulges
**Prompt**: "Explain why there are TWO tidal bulges, not just one on the Moon side."
**Expected**: Near side: Moon's gravity pulls water. Far side: Earth pulled more than water (centrifugal). Result: two bulges.
