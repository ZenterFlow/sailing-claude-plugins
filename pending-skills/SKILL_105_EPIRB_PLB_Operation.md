# SKILL: Emergency Position Indicating Devices Operation (EPIRB/PLB/AIS) (SKILL_105)

## Description
Activate, deploy, and distinguish between EPIRBs, PLBs, and personal AIS beacons for emergency position transmission, understanding coverage limitations and registration requirements for each device type.

## Prerequisites
- Pre-Departure Safety Briefing and Equipment Verification (SKILL_098)

## Learning Objectives
- Activate EPIRB and PLB correctly in emergency
- Differentiate device coverage ranges and receiving stations
- Understand registration requirements and portability limitations
- Select appropriate device for vessel vs personal use

**Device Activation and Operation:**

**EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon):**

**Activation Method:**
1. **Manual Activation:** Remove from bracket, deploy antenna, switch to ON
2. **Automatic Activation:** Water sensor triggers when submerged (hull-mounted units)
3. **Activation Indication:** LED flashes and audible beep confirms transmission

**Transmission Characteristics:**
- **Frequency:** 406 MHz primary distress frequency
- **Signal Content:** Vessel identification, GPS coordinates, emergency nature
- **Satellite System:** COSPAS-SARSAT global coverage
- **Range:** Global (worldwide satellite reception)
- **Registration:** MUST be registered to vessel with coastguard - NOT transferable vessel-to-vessel without re-registration

**Mounting Requirements:**
- **Best Location:** Easy access in rough weather, typically near helm
- **Avoid Accidental Activation:** Not in location where it can be bumped or knocked
- **Float-Free:** Category I EPIRBs must be in automatic release bracket

**PLB (Personal Locator Beacon):**

**Activation Method:**
1. **Deploy Antenna:** Pull antenna to full extension
2. **Power On:** Press and hold activation button (typically 3+ seconds)
3. **Position Acquisition:** Wait 2-5 minutes for GPS lock
4. **Confirmation:** LED sequence indicates successful transmission

**Transmission Characteristics:**
- **Frequency:** 406 MHz (same satellite system as EPIRB)
- **Range:** Global satellite reception
- **GPS Integration:** Internal GPS provides position coordinates
- **Subscription:** No subscription fees (one-time purchase)
- **Registration:** Registered to PERSON, not vessel - portable across vessels, land use

**Key Differences from EPIRB:**
- **Portability:** Can be carried ashore for hiking/mountaineering
- **Battery Life:** Typically 24 hours vs 48+ hours for EPIRB
- **Activation:** Manual only (no automatic water activation)
- **Buoyancy:** May not be buoyant (check model specifications)
- **Compliance:** NOT part of GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System) - may not meet same standards as EPIRB

**Personal AIS (Automatic Identification System):**

**Activation Method:**
- **Water Activation:** Contact with water automatically activates
- **Manual Activation:** Press button to activate SOS strobe and transmission

**Transmission Characteristics:**
- **System:** VHF-based AIS network
- **Range:** Typically 4 nautical miles (VHF line-of-sight)
- **Signal Content:** MOB alert with GPS coordinates transmitted to all AIS-equipped vessels
- **Visual Alert:** Powerful integral strobe light, often with SOS pattern
- **Subscription:** No fees (uses AIS infrastructure)

**Limitations:**
- **Range Restricted:** Requires receiving vessel/station within VHF range
- **Not Satellite:** Will not alert rescue services directly
- **AIS Requirement:** Only vessels with AIS receivers will detect alarm
- **Offshore Use:** Limited effectiveness beyond coastal waters

**SART (Search And Rescue Transponder):**

**Activation Method:**
1. **Manual Switch:** Turn to ON position
2. **Automatic Standby:** Some models activate on water contact
3. **Radar Interrogation:** Responds to X-band radar signals (9 GHz)

**Radar Display Pattern:**
- **Visual Appearance:** Series of 12 dots or arcs on radar screen
- **Pattern:** Forms line pointing directly to SART location
- **Range:** Limited by radar power (typically 5-10 nautical miles)
- **Homing:** Allows rescue vessel to steer directly along dotted line to beacon

**Mounting Location:**
- **Best Position:** In or near helm position
- **Avoid Accidental Activation:** Not where it can be activated by gear or crew
- **Accessibility:** Must be accessible in rough weather conditions

**Device Selection Matrix:**

**For Vessel Emergency (12+ m vessels):**
- **Primary:** EPIRB (registered to vessel)
- **Secondary:** SART (for radar homing by rescuers)
- **Backup:** PLB for skipper (if abandoning vessel)

**For Personal Safety (all crew):**
- **Offshore:** PLB (global coverage, satellite alert)
- **Coastal/Inshore:** Personal AIS (alerts nearby vessels rapidly)
- **Best Practice:** Carry both PLB and personal AIS when offshore

**Registration Requirements:**
- **EPIRB:** Vessel details (name, MMSI, description, emergency contacts)
- **PLB:** Personal details (name, address, emergency contacts, medical info)
- **Update Frequency:** Annually or when details change
- **False Alerts:** Contact rescue center immediately if accidental activation occurs

## Common Errors
- Activating EPIRB when PLB would be more appropriate (and vice versa)
- Not registering device or failing to update registration
- Expecting personal AIS to work beyond VHF range offshore
- Storing EPIRB where it cannot be accessed in rough weather
- Failing to understand that PLB is not GMDSS-compliant
- Accidental SART activation by improper stowage location

## Assessment
- Demonstrate correct EPIRB activation sequence including antenna deployment
- Explain four key differences between EPIRB and PLB
- Identify optimal mounting location for SART and justify choice
- Predict radar display pattern when SART is interrogated
- Calculate expected range of personal AIS in 2m wave height conditions
- Show PLB registration documentation and explain update requirements
- Determine appropriate device selection for given scenario: coastal day sail vs offshore passage
