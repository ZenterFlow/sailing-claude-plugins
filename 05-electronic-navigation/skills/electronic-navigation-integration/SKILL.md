## Purpose

Integrate all electronic navigation systems into a cohesive navigation plan, using each system's strengths while compensating for weaknesses and maintaining mandatory paper chart backup. This skill teaches the complete workflow for professional passage execution using both electronic and paper methods.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you:
- Ask about integrating electronic and paper navigation
- Need to create a comprehensive passage plan
- Want to understand cross-verification procedures
- Ask about backup navigation methods
- Inquire about electronic system failure procedures
- Need to comply with legal paper chart requirements
- Request the complete navigation workflow

## Behavior

### Integration Framework

**Passage Planning - Dual Approach:**
1. **Paper chart:** Plot primary track, waypoints, hazards
2. **Electronic:** Enter waypoints, verify track matches paper
3. **Cross-check:** Ensure both show safe passage
4. **Backup:** Paper chart always accessible and plotted

**Active Navigation Loop (Continuous):**
- **Primary (every 15 min):** GPS position on plotter
- **Verification (every 30 min):** Radar range fix or depth check
- **Paper update (every hour):** Plot position on paper chart
- **Log entry:** Record position, course, speed, depth
- **Cross-check:** If systems disagree, investigate immediately

### System Roles

- **GPS:** Primary position source
- **Radar:** Navigation fix, collision detection
- **AIS:** Vessel identification, collision avoidance
- **Depth:** Position verification, hazard warning
- **Log:** DR calculation, speed through water
- **Plotter:** Route monitoring, XTE, TTG

### Failure Scenarios

**GPS fails:** Use radar ranges, depth contours, visual fixes
**Radar fails:** Rely on GPS, AIS, visual lookout
**Plotter fails:** Use GPS standalone with paper chart
**All electronics fail:** DR/EP from last known position
**Depth fails:** Navigate by position only, avoid shallow areas

### Legal Compliance

- Paper charts mandatory on all vessels
- Paper passage plan required
- Positions must be plotted on paper
- Electronics are aids, not primary means
- Recreational plotters not official charts

### Cross-Verification Protocol

I'll guide you through position verification:
- GPS position should match radar ranges to charted objects
- Depth should match charted depth + tide for GPS position
- COG should approximate course steered ± tide/leeway
- If depth < expected, GPS position is wrong or in hazard
- If radar ranges don't match GPS, investigate error source

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Not plotting positions on paper chart
❌ No backup plan for electronics failure
❌ Assuming electronics are infallible
❌ Not cross-checking between systems
❌ Ignoring discrepancies between systems

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Create dual paper/electronic passage plan
- Demonstrate position cross-check using 3 methods
- Respond to simulated GPS failure
- Show paper chart with hourly positions plotted
- Explain legal requirements
