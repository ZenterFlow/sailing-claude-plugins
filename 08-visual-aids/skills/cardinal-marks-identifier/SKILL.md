**RYA Yachtmaster – Cardinal Marks Identification**

## Purpose
Teach identification of cardinal marks (North, East, South, West) used in IALA buoyage systems to indicate safe water around hazards. Covers topmarks, colors, light characteristics, and the "clock face" memory method.

## Activation Triggers
- "cardinal marks"
- "north cardinal"
- "east cardinal"
- "identify cardinal"
- "cardinal buoy"
- "topmarks"

## Behaviour
1. **Explain cardinal system**: Marks placed in 4 compass quadrants around hazard
2. **Teach identification** by:
   - Topmark shapes (double cones)
   - Colors (yellow and black bands)
   - Light characteristics (Q/VQ flashes)
3. **Provide memory aids**: Clock face method, "WE" (West/East) rule
4. **Quiz mode**: Show mark, ask for identification

**Cardinal Mark System**:
```
         NORTH
    Pass NORTH of mark
    Topmark: ▲▲ (points up)
    Colors: Black over Yellow
    Light: Q or VQ continuous

WEST              EAST
Pass WEST     Pass EAST
▲◄ (waist)    ►▲ (eggs)
Y-B-Y         B-Y-B
VQ(9)         VQ(3)

         SOUTH
    Pass SOUTH of mark
    Topmark: ▼▼ (points down)
    Colors: Yellow over Black
    Light: VQ(6)+LFl

```

**Memory Aid - Clock Face**:
- North: 12 o'clock - cones point to 12 (UP)
- East: 3 o'clock - cones point away (3 flashes)
- South: 6 o'clock - cones point to 6 (DOWN)
- West: 9 o'clock - cones point away (9 flashes)

## Example Session
User: "What's a north cardinal mark?"

Returns:
```
NORTH CARDINAL MARK
═══════════════════════════════════════

PURPOSE: Indicates safe water is NORTH of the mark

TOPMARK:
   ▲
   ▲  (Two cones, points UP)

COLORS:
Black band on top
Yellow band on bottom

LIGHT CHARACTERISTIC:
Q (Quick continuous)
or
VQ (Very Quick continuous)

MEMORY AID:
• "Points up like an arrow going north"
• Clock face: 12 o'clock position
• Light: Continuous (no groups)

USAGE:
→ Pass to the NORTH (above) this mark
→ Hazard is to the SOUTH of the mark
→ Common at rocks/shoals extending northward
```

## Teaching Notes
- "Pass on the named side" - North cardinal = pass north
- Topmarks show direction: North points up, South points down
- East/West: "WE" rule - West=Waist (Y-B-Y), East=Eggs (B-Y-B)
- Lights: Remember flash groups (3, 6, 9) for E/S/W
