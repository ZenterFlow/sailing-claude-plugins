# SKILL: Collision Avoidance Decision Making (SKILL_95)

## Description
Execute correct collision avoidance actions based on vessel hierarchy, encounter type, and visibility conditions, applying the "turn to starboard" principle.

## Prerequisites
- Day Shapes and Vessel Identification (SKILL_94)

## Learning Objectives
- Apply correct action for head-on, crossing, and overtaking situations
- Execute stand-on vessel responsibilities properly
- Implement last-resort avoiding action
- Apply restricted visibility rules
- Make correct decisions with multiple vessel encounters

**The "Turn to Starboard" Principle**

**Fundamental Rule:** When avoiding collision, turning to starboard is preferred because:
- Shows other vessel a different aspect (clear intention)
- Aligns with head-on passing rule (port-to-port)
- Avoids turning into the path of crossing vessel
- Standard expectation in international waters

**Head-On Situation (Rule 14)**

**Vessels Meeting Nearly End-On:**
- **Both Vessels:** Alter course to STARBOARD
- **Result:** Pass port-to-port (left side to left side)
- **Action:** Early, substantial alteration
- **Signal:** 1 short blast (turning to starboard)
- **Alternative:** If Pass Starboard-to-Starboard, 2 short blasts (port turn)

**Crossing Situation (Rule 15)**

**Vessel on Starboard Side:**
- **Status:** Give-way vessel
- **Action:** Alter course to avoid (preferably starboard)
- **May:** Slow down or stop if necessary
- **Signal:** Not specifically required but can use maneuvering signals

**Vessel on Port Side:**
- **Status:** Stand-on vessel
- **Action:** Maintain course and speed
- **Vigilance:** Monitor give-way vessel's action
- **Last Resort:** If give-way vessel fails to act, turn away obviously

**Overtaking Situation (Rule 13)**

**Overtaking Vessel (A):**
- **Status:** Always give-way vessel, regardless of vessel type
- **Action:** Keep well clear of overtaken vessel
- **Signal:** 
  - Starboard side: 1 short blast (intention to overtake)
  - Port side: 2 short blasts (intention to overtake)
- **Agreement:** Overtaken vessel may signal agreement (1 long-1 short-1 long-1 short)

**Overtaken Vessel (B):**
- **Status:** Stand-on vessel
- **Action:** Maintain course and speed
- **May:** Signal agreement to overtaking intention
- **Should Not:** Accelerate or alter course

**Determining Overtaking:**
- **Test:** If vessel is more than 22.5° abaft the beam (astern sector), it's overtaking
- **Responsibility:** Burden of proof on overtaking vessel
- **Continues:** Until finally past and clear

**Stand-On Vessel Responsibilities (Rule 17)**

**Initial Action:**
- **Maintain Course:** Hold current heading
- **Maintain Speed:** Do NOT slow down or speed up
- **Vigilance:** Watch give-way vessel's actions
- **Even If:** Other vessel is larger (maintain course/speed)

**When Action Required:**
- **Give-Way Vessel Fails:** Stand-on vessel must act when collision imminent
- **Last Resort:** Turn away deliberately and obviously
- **Direction:** Turn away from the other vessel
- **Speed:** May slow down or stop

**Prohibited Action:**
- **Do NOT:** Turn to port for vessel on own port side
- **Do NOT:** Make last-minute small alterations
- **Do NOT:** Increase speed when being overtaken

**Action if Give-Way Vessel Fails (Rule 17b):**
- **Option 1:** Alter course away from other vessel (starboard turn preferred)
- **Option 2:** Slow down or stop
- **Option 3:** Combination of both
- **Key:** Action must be deliberate and obvious

**Multiple Vessel Encounters**

**Prioritization Process:**
1. **Identify Hierarchy:** NUC &gt; RAM &gt; Fishing &gt; Sail &gt; Power
2. **Determine Encounter:** Head-on, crossing, overtaking
3. **Assign Roles:** Give-way vs stand-on for each
4. **Plan Action:** Starboard turn preferred for all give-way vessels
5. **Monitor All:** Keep track of multiple vessels simultaneously

**Complex Scenario Example:**
- **Vessel A (Power):** Overtaking Vessel B
- **Vessel B (Sail):** Being overtaken by A, crossing ahead of Vessel C (Fishing)
- **Vessel C (Fishing):** Has RAM status due to gear

**Actions:**
- **A:** Give-way to B (overtaking), keep clear of C
- **B:** Stand-on to A, give-way to C (sail gives way to fishing)
- **C:** Stand-on to both A and B (fishing RAM)

**Restricted Visibility Rules (Rule 19)**

**No Stand-On/Give-Way:**
- **All Vessels:** Must proceed with caution
- **Safe Speed:** Reduce to minimum for conditions
- **Detection:** By radar, sound, or other means
- **Action:** Positive avoiding action early

**Detecting Other Vessels:**
- **Radar Plotting:** Determine CPA/TCPA
- **Sound Signals:** Identify vessel type by signal pattern
- **VHF:** Contact other vessels to confirm intentions

**Avoiding Action in Restrict Visibility:**
- **Power Vessels:** Turn to starboard if vessel ahead detected
- **Course Alteration:** Large enough to be obvious on radar
- **Speed Reduction:** Stop if necessary
- **Avoid:** Turn to port for vessel forward of beam

**Sound Signals in Fog (Key Identifiers):**
- **1 Long:** Power vessel making way
- **2 Long:** Power vessel stopped (not making way)
- **1 Long + 2 Short:** Sail, RAM, NUC, Fishing, Towing
- **1 Long + 3 Short:** Last vessel in tow
- **4 Short:** Pilot vessel on duty
- **1 Short + 1 Long:** Diver down (Morse A)

**Pecking Order in Restricted Visibility**
**Priority (Higher Listed = Higher Priority):**
1. NUC (Not Under Command)
2. RAM (Restricted in Ability to Manoeuvre)
3. Fishing/Trawling
4. Constrained by Draught
5. Power Driven Vessel
6. Sailing Vessel

**Sailing Vessel in Fog:**
- **Sound Signal:** 1 long + 2 short blasts
- **Lights:** Sailing vessel lights (not tricolour)
- **Action:** Must avoid all of above vessel types

**Motor Vessel in Fog:**
- **Sound Signal:** 1 long blast (making way) or 2 long (stopped)
- **Lights:** Power vessel lights
- **Action:** Must avoid all vessels except sailing vessels

**Danger Signal (Rule 34d):**
- **Signal:** 5 or more short blasts
- **Meaning:** "I do not understand your intentions" or danger warning
- **Use:** When other vessel's actions are unclear or dangerous

**Last-Minute Avoiding Action**

**When to Take:**
- Give-way vessel fails to act
- Stand-on vessel's safety requires action
- Collision imminent in 1-2 minutes

**How to Take:**
- **Direction:** Turn AWAY from other vessel
- **Magnitude:** Large, obvious alteration
- **Speed:** Reduce or stop if needed
- **Communication:** Use danger signal if appropriate (5 short blasts)

**What to Avoid:**
- **Small Alterations:** Don't change aspect enough
- **Port Turns:** For vessel on port side (confusing)
- **Acceleration:** Especially when being overtaken
- **Last-Second Panic:** Should be deliberate, controlled action

**Local Rules and Departure from IRPCS**

**Port/Harbor Regulations:**
- **Application:** Local rules may apply in controlled waters
- **Status:** May override standard IRPCS requirements
- **Example:** Port traffic control instructions, designated ferry lanes

**Departure from IRPCS (Rule 1):**
- **Permitted:** To avoid immediate danger
- **Requirement:** Departure must be necessary and justified
- **Documentation:** Log reason for departure

## Common Errors
- Turning to port instead of starboard in head-on situation
- Stand-on vessel taking premature action instead of maintaining course
- Overtaking vessel not keeping well clear
- Making small, hesitant alterations instead of bold changes
- Using danger signal (5 blasts) as routine communication
- Forgetting that restricted visibility eliminates stand-on/give-way status

## Assessment
- Determine correct action for head-on crossing situation
- Identify proper overtaking procedure and signals
- Execute stand-on vessel responsibilities until last resort
- Apply restricted visibility rules and sound signals
- Navigate multiple vessel encounter with correct hierarchy
- Use danger signal appropriately in ambiguous situations
- Describe when departure from IRPCS is permissible
