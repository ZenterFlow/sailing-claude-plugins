# Magnetic Interference Sources for Hand Bearing Compass

## Why Deviation Matters (But Can't Be Corrected)

**Critical Difference:**
- **Ship's compass**: Fixed position, can be corrected with deviation table
- **Hand-bearing compass**: Mobile, position varies, cannot be corrected systematically

**Result:**
- Must MINIMIZE deviation at source
- Cannot CORRECT deviation mathematically
- Awareness and technique are primary defenses

## Major Interference Sources

### 1. Engine and Machinery

**Interference Strength:** HIGH ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**Sources:**
- Engine block (cast iron/steel)
- Flywheel, starter motor
- Alternator, generator
- Gearbox, shaft coupling
- Engine-mounted pumps
- Exhaust system (steel)

**Safe Distance:**
- Minimum: 2 meters (6 feet)
- Recommended: 3 meters (10 feet)
- Ideal: 4+ meters (13+ feet)

**Practical Impact:**
```
Standing at helm (typical 1-2m from engine):
  Deviation: ±10-20° possible

Standing on foredeck (4-5m from engine):
  Deviation: ±2-5° typical

Standing amidships, away from engine:
  Deviation: ±3-8° typical
```

**Mitigation:**
- Take bearings from foredeck when possible
- Avoid helm station for critical bearings
- Test compass swing in different locations
- Note which location gives most consistent results

### 2. Electronics and Speakers

**Interference Strength:** MODERATE-HIGH ⚠️⚠️

**Sources:**
- Magnetic speakers (old style, strong)
- VHF radio speakers
- Depth sounder transducers (electric)
- Navigation instrument displays
- Radar units, radar dome
- Autopilot computer, drive unit
- GPS antenna (minimal but present)
- Chart plotter displays
- Stereo system speakers

**Safe Distance:**
- Speakers (old magnetic): 1-2 meters
- Modern electronics: 0.5-1 meter
- Radar (operating): 2 meters
- Autopilot drive: 1-2 meters

**Practical Impact:**
```

  At 2.0m: <±2° deviation

Stereo speakers (magnetic):
  Within 0.3m: ±10-15° deviation
  At 1.0m: ±3-5° deviation
```

**Mitigation:**
- Identify speaker locations on your boat
- Avoid taking bearings near nav station
- Turn off non-essential electronics (doesn't help with magnets)
- Test bearing accuracy in different locations

### 3. Metal Tools and Equipment

**Interference Strength:** MODERATE ⚠️⚠️

**Sources:**
- Wrenches, screwdrivers
- Knives (steel blades)
- Winch handles (steel parts)

### 6. Hull and Keel (Steel/Iron)

**Interference Strength:** MODERATE-HIGH ⚠️⚠️

**Sources:**
- Steel hull (entire structure)
- Iron keel (ballast)
- Steel frames, stiffeners
- Through-hull fittings (bronze: minimal)

**Safe Distance:**
- Cannot distance yourself on steel boat
- Relative effect varies by heading

**Practical Impact:**
```
Steel hull vessel:
  Systematic deviation throughout boat
  Varies with boat's heading
  Similar to ship's compass deviation

Iron keel (GRP hull):
  Deviation typically ±2-5°
  Less systematic than steel hull
```

**Mitigation:**
- **Steel boats:** More critical to understand limitations
- Take multiple bearings, average results
- Use same location consistently (self-consistent errors)
- Cross-check with GPS
- Consider electronic bearing devices
- Understand hand-bearing compass is less accurate on steel boats

```

**Mitigation:**
- Know battery locations on boat
- Avoid bearing positions directly over batteries
- Heavy electrical use may affect readings

## Practical Vessel Mapping

### Create Your Own Deviation Map

**Procedure:**
1. Find reference object with known magnetic bearing
2. Take bearing from multiple locations on boat:
   - Foredeck
   - Mast area
   - Cockpit (multiple spots)
   - Helm
   - Stern
3. Compare all readings
4. Identify best location (most consistent, closest to known bearing)
5. Use that location for all future bearings when possible

**Example Log:**
```
Date: [Date]
Boat: [Name]
Reference Object: Lighthouse X (known bearing 045°M from mooring)

Location                      | Bearing | Deviation | Notes
──────────────────────────────┼─────────┼───────────┼──────────
Foredeck (forward of mast)    | 046°    | +1°       | Good spot ✓
Port side deck (amidships)    | 052°    | +7°       | Near engine
Starboard side (amidships)    | 044°    | -1°       | Good spot ✓
Cockpit (port side)           | 055°    | +10°      | Near helm/engine
Helm position                 | 058°    | +13°      | Bad spot ✗
Stern (pushpit)              | 048°    | +3°       | Acceptable
Nav station                   | 062°    | +17°      | Very bad ✗

RESULT: Use foredeck or starboard side deck for critical bearings
        Avoid helm and nav station
```

## Interference Testing Method

### Simple Test (At Anchor/Mooring)

**Setup:**
1. Identify fixed object at known bearing
2. Stand at clear location
3. Take bearing of object: Record reading

**Test:**
1. Move phone/keys near compass → Note change
2. Move closer to engine → Note change
3. Stand near nav station → Note change
4. Try different locations → Find best spot

**Result:**
- Quantify interference sources on YOUR boat
- Identify best bearing location
- Understand personal item effects

## Deviation vs. Variation (Reminder)

**Variation:**
- Geographic phenomenon
- Same for all compasses at same location
- Can be corrected with chart data
- Affects hand-bearing compass AND ship's compass equally

**Deviation:**
- Vessel-specific phenomenon
- Different for each compass location on boat
- Ship's compass: Can be corrected (deviation table)
- Hand-bearing compass: **Cannot be corrected** (location varies)

**Therefore:**
- Hand-bearing compass accuracy depends entirely on minimizing deviation
- Technique and awareness are critical
- No mathematical correction possible
- Accept limitations, work within them

---

## Expected Accuracy

**Best Case (Good Technique):**
- Clear location, no interference
- Calm conditions, steady platform
- Experienced operator
- Accuracy: ±2-3°

**Typical Case:**
- Some unavoidable interference
- Normal sea conditions
- Competent operator
- Accuracy: ±3-5°

**Poor Case:**
- High interference area
- Rough conditions
- Hasty bearing
- Accuracy: ±5-10°

**Worst Case:**
- Taking bearing at helm/nav station
- Metal tools nearby
- Rough seas
- Accuracy: ±10-20° (unreliable)

**Conclusion:**
Hand-bearing compass is backup navigation tool, not precision instrument. Use within limitations, cross-check with GPS when accuracy critical.
