## Chart Correction Data
**Paper/Raster Charts:**

- Corrections applied manually with pen/ink

**Electronic Charts (ENC):**

- Electronic charts cannot be updated incrementally like paper

## Common Errors
- Assuming chart is "fully corrected" on given date

- Using outdated electronic chart data
- Not verifying temporary vs permanent corrections

## Assessment
