# SKILL: Cardinal Marks Navigation (SKILL_71)

## Description
Master cardinal marks that indicate safe passage relative to compass directions, enabling hazard avoidance from any approach direction without requiring knowledge of buoyage direction.

## Prerequisites
- IALA Buoyage System Fundamentals (SKILL_69)

## Learning Objectives
- Identify all four cardinal marks by color, shape, and topmark
- Execute correct passage based on compass direction
- Interpret cardinal light sequences
- Apply cardinal system to hazard avoidance
- Distinguish cardinal marks from lateral marks

**North Cardinal Mark:**
- **Purpose:** Pass to the north of this mark; hazard is to the south
- **Color:** Black (top) over yellow (bottom)
- **Shape:** Pillar or spar
- **Topmark:** Two black cones pointing up
- **Light Color:** White
- **Light Sequence:** Continuous quick flashing (Q) or very quick (VQ) or ultra quick (UQ)
- **Memory Aid:** Arrows point to black color (top)

**South Cardinal Mark:**
- **Purpose:** Pass to the south of this mark; hazard is to the north
- **Color:** Yellow (top) over black (bottom)
- **Shape:** Pillar or spar
- **Topmark:** Two black cones pointing down
- **Light Color:** White
- **Light Sequence:** Q(6)+long Fl1 10s (6 quick flashes plus 1 long flash within 10 seconds)
- **Memory Aid:** Arrows point to black color (bottom)

**East Cardinal Mark:**
- **Purpose:** Pass to the east of this mark; hazard is to the west
- **Color:** Black-yellow-black horizontal bands
- **Shape:** Pillar or spar
- **Topmark:** Two black cones pointing up and down (base to base)
- **Light Color:** White
- **Light Sequence:** Q(3)5s (3 quick flashes within 5 seconds)
- **Memory Aid:** Arrows point to black colors (top and bottom)

**West Cardinal Mark:**
- **Purpose:** Pass to the west of this mark; hazard is to the east
- **Color:** Yellow-black-yellow horizontal bands
- **Shape:** Pillar or spar
- **Topmark:** Two black cones pointing toward each other (point to point)
- **Light Color:** White
- **Light Sequence:** Q(9)10s (9 quick flashes within 10 seconds)
- **Memory Aid:** Arrows point to black colors (middle)

**Key Advantage:**
Cardinal marks work from any approach direction. A skipper only needs a compass to determine safe passage, unlike lateral marks which require knowledge of direction of buoyage.

**Visibility:**
- Lit buoys: Visible up to 2 miles at night
- Shapes/colors: Visible up to 1 mile in daylight

## Common Errors
- Confusing east and west cardinal color patterns
- Misremembering light flash counts (3-6-9 pattern helps)
- Forgetting that hazard is opposite the safe side
- Mixing up cone pointing directions for topmarks
- Assuming cardinal marks indicate channel sides like lateral marks

## Assessment
- Identify cardinal mark type from color bands and topmark
- Determine safe passage side for any approach heading
- Calculate hazard location based on mark type
- Interpret light sequence timing and pattern
- Navigate around cardinal-marked hazard
