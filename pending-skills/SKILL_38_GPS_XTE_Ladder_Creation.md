# SKILL: GPS Cross Track Error (XTE) Ladder

## Description
Create a cross track error ladder on the chart to monitor GPS deviation from planned ground track and quickly determine position and corrective action.

## Prerequisites
- Ground track plotting
- Distance measurement

## Learning Objectives
- Draw parallel lines at set distances from planned track
- Mark perpendicular crossing lines at regular intervals
- Interpret GPS XTE readout using ladder
- Determine distance to waypoint from ladder
- Apply for high-speed navigation or narrow channels

## Ladder Construction
**Parallel Lines:**
1. Plot intended ground track (course line) on chart
2. Draw parallel lines 0.5 NM each side of track (or 1.0 NM)
3. Label: "0.5M Port" and "0.5M Stbd"
4. Add additional lines if channel width requires

**Crossing Lines:**
1. Draw perpendicular lines crossing track at 0.5 or 1.0 mile intervals
2. Label with distance to waypoint (e.g., 3.0M, 2.5M, 2.0M)
3. Creates grid pattern for quick position reference

**GPS Interpretation:**
- XTE readout shows lateral distance from track (e.g., 0.2M Port)
- Distance to waypoint given by crossing line position
- Example: GPS shows 0.2M Port, crossing 2.5M line → position is 0.2M left of track, 2.5M from waypoint

**Corrective Action:**
- GPS often shows arrow direction to return to track
- Some displays: "Off to Port/Starboard"
- Helmsman steers toward arrow until XTE = 0

## Common Errors
- Parallel lines not truly parallel (use plotter carefully)
- Inconsistent spacing of crossing lines
- Forgetting to convert between GPS datum and chart datum
- Not labeling lines clearly for quick reference

## Assessment
- Construct XTE ladder for 5-mile channel approach
- Plot 4 positions from GPS XTE readings in &lt;20 seconds each
- Determine corrective heading from XTE data
- Explain benefits for fast craft vs slow sailboat
