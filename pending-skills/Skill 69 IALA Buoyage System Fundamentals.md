# SKILL: IALA Buoyage System Fundamentals (SKILL_69)

## Description
Master the IALA buoyage system framework, including the two global regions (A and B) and the core categories of navigation marks that comprise this international standard.

## Prerequisites
- Basic chart reading
- Understanding of port/starboard terminology

## Learning Objectives
- Identify IALA Region A and B geographical coverage
- Differentiate between the five main mark categories
- Understand "direction of buoyage" concept
- Explain regional color inversion between IALA A and B
- Recognize where direction of buoyage is indicated on charts

**IALA System Overview:**
The IALA (International Association of Lighthouse Authorities) buoyage system is the global standard for maritime navigation aids, divided into two regions with nearly identical shapes but inverted colors for lateral marks.

**IALA Region A:**
- **Coverage:** Europe, Australia, New Zealand, parts of Africa, most of Asia (excluding Philippines, Japan, Korea)
- **Lateral Marks:** Red to port (left), green to starboard (right) when proceeding in direction of buoyage
- **Motto:** "Red to port"

**IALA Region B:**
- **Coverage:** North America, Central America, South America, Philippines, Japan, Korea
- **Lateral Marks:** Green to port, red to starboard when proceeding in direction of buoyage
- **Motto:** "Green to port"

**Direction of Buoyage:**
- **Definition:** The direction taken when approaching a harbor from seaward or along coasts
- **Chart Symbol:** Displayed as a magenta arrow when required
- **Determination:** Set by buoyage authorities, normally clockwise around land masses
- **Critical for:** Proper interpretation of lateral marks

**Core Categories of Marks:**
1. **Lateral Marks:** Indicate port and starboard sides of channels (colors differ by region)
2. **Cardinal Marks:** Indicate safe side to pass based on compass directions (identical globally)
3. **Isolated Danger Mark:** Marks isolated hazards with navigable water all around
4. **Safe Water Mark:** Indicates safe open water, clear of hazards
5. **Special Marks:** Indicate special areas or features (pipelines, race courses, etc.)

**Key Principle:**
Only lateral mark colors change between regions. Shapes, light sequences, and all other mark types remain identical worldwide.

## Common Errors
- Assuming all marks differ between regions (only lateral colors change)
- Confusing direction of buoyage when leaving vs entering harbor
- Forgetting to check which region applies to your chart
- Mixing up "red to port" vs "green to port" mnemonics between regions

## Assessment
- Identify correct region for a given location
- Explain color scheme for port/starboard marks in both regions
- Interpret direction of buoyage from chart symbol
- Determine safe passage side for non-lateral marks
- Troubleshoot navigation error based on regional confusion
