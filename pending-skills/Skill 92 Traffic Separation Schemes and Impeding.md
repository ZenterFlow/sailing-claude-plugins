# SKILL: Traffic Separation Schemes and Impeding (SKILL_92)

## Description
Navigate Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS) correctly, understand impeding obligations, and apply special vessel hierarchy rules for collision avoidance.

## Prerequisites
- IRPCS General Rules and Watchkeeping (SKILL_91)

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Rule 10 for TSS navigation
- Understand "impede" vs "give way" distinctions
- Identify vessel hierarchy and obligations
- Execute correct joining, leaving, and crossing procedures
- Recognize inshore zone usage rights

**Traffic Separation Schemes (Rule 10)**

**General Principles:**
- **Purpose:** Organize vessel traffic flow in congested areas
- **Regulation:** Mandatory compliance when scheme is adopted and charted
- **Does NOT Relieve:** Any vessel from obligations under other rules

**Vessels USING a Lane:**
- **Direction:** Proceed in general direction of traffic flow for that lane
- **Separation:** Keep clear of separation lines/zones as far as practicable
- **Lane Termination:** Normally join/leave at termination of lane
- **Joining/Leaving:** From either side, at smallest possible angle to traffic flow
- **Crossing:** Avoid crossing lanes when practicable

**Crossing Procedures (When Obliged):**
- **Angle:** Cross on heading as nearly as practicable at RIGHT ANGLES to traffic flow
- **Purpose:** Makes vessel's intention clear to traffic in lane
- **Speed:** Maintain steady speed during crossing

**Inshore Traffic Zones (Rule 10(d))**
**Who MAY Use:**
- Vessels under 20 meters in length
- Sailing vessels
- Vessels engaged in fishing
- Vessels en route to/from port within the zone
- Vessels avoiding immediate danger

**Who Should NOT Use:**
- Vessels that can safely use adjacent traffic lane

**Separation Zones (Rule 10(e))**
**Entering/Crossing Separation Zone Permitted:**
- Emergency to avoid immediate danger
- Engaging in fishing within separation zone

**Vessel Hierarchy and Pecking Order**
**Rule 18 - Vessels Constrained by Their Draft (CBD)**
**Definition:** Vessel restricted to narrow channel by draft
- **Must NOT Impede:** Other vessels must not impede CBD vessel
- **Still Give-Way:** CBD vessel remains give-way vessel in crossing/overtaking situations
- **Example:** Large tanker in dredged channel - small vessels must stay clear but tanker still gives way to crossing vessel

**Rule 18 Priority List (HIGHER priority at TOP):**
1. **Not Under Command (NUC):** Unable to maneuver as required by rules
2. **Restricted in Ability to Manoeuvre (RAM):** Due to nature of work
3. **Fishing Vessel:** Engaged in fishing (trawling/dredging)
4. **Sailing Vessel:** Under sail alone (not motor sailing)
5. **Power Driven Vessel:** Including motor sailing yachts
6. **Vessel Constrained by Draught:** Has right not to be impeded but still gives way

**General Pecking Order (Lower Must Give Way to Higher):**
- **Power Driven:** Gives way to all except RAM/NUC/fishing when not in TSS
- **Sailing:** Gives way to RAM, NUC, fishing vessels
- **Fishing:** Gives way to RAM and NUC
- **RAM/NUC:** All others must give way to these

**"Impede" vs "Give Way" Distinction**

**"Give Way" (Standard Crossing/Overtaking):**
- **Action:** Required to keep well clear of other vessel
- **Hierarchy:** Based on vessel type and encounter situation
- **Example:** Power vessel gives way to sailing vessel crossing from starboard

**"Not to Impede" (Special Obligation):**
- **Action:** Take early action to allow sufficient sea-room for safe passage
- **Obligation Continues:** Even if risk of collision develops
- **Does NOT Relive Other Vessel:** Other vessel must still comply with give-way rules if risk develops
- **Example:** Small vessel must not impede CBD vessel in narrow channel, but if collision risk develops, CBD vessel must still give way

**Practical Application Example:**
**Scenario:** You are in a power-driven vessel (14m). Another vessel is on your port side crossing.
- **Normal Situation:** Other vessel is give-way, you are stand-on
- **If Other Vessel is CBD:** You must not impede its passage (stay clear), BUT if collision risk develops, other vessel still gives way
- **Action:** Take early action to allow passage, monitor situation

**Special Vessel Identification:**

**Constrained by Draught (Rule 28):**
- **Day Shape:** Cylinder
- **Lights:** Three vertical red lights
- **Reminder:** Do not obstruct, but treat as give-way vessel in encounters

**Restricted in Ability to Manoeuvre (Rule 27):**
- **Day Shape:** Ball-diamond-ball vertically
- **Night Lights:** Red-white-red vertical all-round lights
- **Common Operations:** Underwater operations, dredging, cable laying, maintaining navigation aids

**Not Under Command (Rule 27):**
- **Day Shape:** Two black balls vertically
- **Night Lights:** Two vertical red lights
- **Meaning:** Severely restricted in ability to deviate from course

**Fishing Vessels (Rule 26):**
- **Trawling:** Green over white vertical lights, cone apexes together shape, masthead light abaft and higher
- **Other Fishing:** Red over white vertical lights, cone apexes together shape
- **Gear Warning:** If gear extends &gt;150m, all-round white light or cone apex upward in gear direction

**Towing Operations (Rule 24):**
- **Length ≤200m:** Standard RAM shapes/lights plus amber towing light
- **Length &gt;200m:** Additional masthead light, diamond shapes showing length
- **Last Vessel Sound Signal:** 1 long + 3 short blasts (fog)

**Traffic Separation Scheme Sound Signals**
- **Vessel in TSS in fog:** 1 long blast every 2 minutes
- **Last vessel in tow:** 1 long + 3 short blasts every 2 minutes
- **Towing vessel:** 1 long + 2 short blasts every 2 minutes

## Common Errors
- Failing to cross TSS at right angles
- Using inshore zone when able to safely use traffic lane
- Assuming CBD vessel has absolute right of way (forgetting give-way obligations)
- Not understanding "impede" continues even after risk develops
- Crossing separation zones without emergency justification
- Anchoring in TSS lane (prohibited)

## Assessment
- Execute correct TSS joining/leaving/crossing procedure
- Identify vessel hierarchy from lights/shapes and apply correct action
- Distinguish between "give way" and "not to impede" situations
- Navigate narrow channel without impeding larger vessels
- Determine when inshore zone usage is permitted
- Apply correct sound signals in TSS during restricted visibility
- Analyze complex multi-vessel encounter with hierarchy rules
