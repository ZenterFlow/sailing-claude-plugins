# SKILL: Distress Signal Communication Protocols (SKILL_106)

## Description
Execute proper Mayday call sequences using DSC VHF and voice procedures, deploy visual distress signals correctly, and apply internationally recognized distress signal regulations in grave and imminent danger situations.

## Prerequisites
- Pre-Departure Safety Briefing and Equipment Verification (SKILL_098)
- Emergency Position Indicating Devices Operation (EPIRB/PLB/AIS) (SKILL_105)

## Learning Objectives
- Transmit Mayday call using correct sequence and content
- Deploy flares using timing and positioning tactics for maximum visibility
- Identify and execute alternative distress signals when equipment fails
- Distinguish between Mayday, Pan-Pan, and Sécurité urgency levels

**Mayday Call Procedure (DSC Enabled VHF):**

**Digital Selective Calling Activation:**
1. **Open Protective Cover:** Lift cover on dedicated Mayday button
2. **Single Press:** Press button once to begin sequence
3. **Designate Nature:** Select emergency type if time permits:
   - Man Overboard (MOB)
   - Fire
   - Holed and Sinking
   - Piracy
   - Medical Emergency
4. **Hold for Countdown:** Maintain pressure until countdown completes (typically 5 seconds)
5. **Automatic Transmission:** DSC sends digital alert with vessel MMSI and position

**Voice Mayday Call Format (On Channel 16):**

**Transmission Sequence:**
1. **Distress Call:** "MAYDAY" spoken three times
2. **Vessel Identification:** "This is [vessel name]" repeated three times
3. **Callsign and MMSI:** State vessel call sign and MMSI number
4. **Repeat Mayday:** "MAYDAY [vessel name]"
5. **Repeat ID:** Callsign and MMSI again
6. **Position:** State exact position (bearing and distance from known point, or lat/long)
7. **Nature of Distress:** Clear description (e.g., "Holed and sinking")
8. **Assistance Required:** "I REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE"
9. **Persons On Board:** Number of people including any in water
10. **Additional Information:** Life raft availability, vessel description, etc.
11. **Over:** Release PTT and await response

**Example Call:**
MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY
This is yacht Indigo, yacht Indigo, yacht Indigo
Callsign ABC123 MMSI 235123456
MAYDAY yacht Indigo
Callsign ABC123 MMSI 235123456
My position 090°(T) from Berry Head 2.5 nautical miles
Holed and sinking
Require immediate assistance
Three persons on board including one in water
Have no life raft

**Mayday Card Preparation:**
- Create vessel-specific template with blanks for emergency details
- Laminate and mount next to VHF
- Include: vessel name, callsign, MMSI, typical position format
- Reduces stress and errors during actual emergency

**Visual Distress Signals:**

**Rocket Parachute Flares:**
- **Quantity:** Typically 4 red rockets carried
- **Activation:** Follow manufacturer instructions (varies by brand)
- **Deployment:** 
  - Fire first rocket at 45° angle downwind
  - Fire second rocket 1-2 minutes after first to confirm position
  - Second flare allows rescuers to determine direction
- **Timing:** Best at night or low visibility when aircraft/vessels are visible

**Hand-Held Flares:**
- **Quantity:** Typically 4 red hand-held flares
- **Duration:** Burn 60 seconds at 15,000 candela
- **Use:** Attract attention of nearby vessels or aircraft
- **Safety:** Hold leeward, point away from body, over side of vessel
- **Timing:** Use when rescue vessel is within visual range

**Orange Smoke Flares:**
- **Quantity:** Typically 2 orange smoke flares
- **Best Conditions:** Daylight, light winds
- **Duration:** 3 minutes of dense orange smoke
- **Use:** Mark position for air search aircraft
- **Deployment:** Downwind side of vessel

**Warning Flares (White):**
- **Quantity:** Typically 2 white flares
- **Purpose:** Warn other vessels of your position (not distress)
- **Use:** Prevent collision in restricted visibility

**Alternative International Distress Signals:**

**Sound Signals:**
- **Gun or Explosive:** Fired at intervals of about one minute
- **Fog Horn Continuous:** Continuous sounding with any fog-signaling apparatus

**Visual Signals:**
- **Flames:** Burning tar barrel, oil barrel on deck
- **Flag and Ball:** Square flag with ball or ball-like object above/below
- **Arm Signals:** Slowly and repeatedly raising/lowering arms outstretched to sides
- **SOS Flashlight:** Morse code ...---... with any light source

**Radio Signals:**
- **Morse SOS:** Signal lamp, Aldis lamp, or flashed light
- **NC Flag:** International code flag NC (November Charlie)
- **DSC Alert:** Digital selective calling on VHF Ch 70, MF/HF distress frequencies
- **Inmarsat Alert:** Ship-to-shore distress via satellite

**Out-of-Date Flare Disposal:**
- **DO NOT:** Fire expired flares (can misfire and maim)
- **DO NOT:** Put in household rubbish bin
- **Correct Method:** Contact local coastguard station - they may accept them
- **Alternative:** Some chandlers will take them for proper disposal
- **Safety:** Transport in original container, keep away from heat

**Distress Signal Selection Matrix:**

**Daytime, Good Visibility:**
- Orange smoke flares
- Flag and ball signal
- Arm signals
- SOS light flashes (if within visual range)

**Nighttime, Good Visibility:**
- Rocket parachute flares (red)
- Hand-held red flares
- Flashing SOS with torch
- Flame signals

**Restricted Visibility (Fog):**
- Sound signals (gun, fog horn)
- DSC Mayday alert
- EPIRB activation

**Offshore Beyond Visual Range:**
- EPIRB activation (primary)
- DSC Mayday (secondary)
- PLB activation if abandoning vessel

## Common Errors
- Using outdated Mayday format found on internet (not current)
- Forgetting to release PTT switch after Mayday call (cannot hear response)
- Firing only one rocket flare (second needed for direction confirmation)
- Using white flares for distress (warning only, not recognized as distress)
- Firing flares directly into wind (dangerous, can blow back)
- Transmitting Mayday when Pan-Pan would be appropriate (non life-threatening)
- Not having Mayday card prepared and accessible

## Assessment
- Transmit complete voice Mayday call in correct sequence within 90 seconds
- Deploy red rocket flare at proper angle and timing
- Identify six internationally recognized alternative distress signals (non-pyrotechnic)
- Explain when to use Pan-Pan vs Mayday
- Describe proper out-of-date flare disposal procedure
- Demonstrate SOS Morse code signaling with torch
- Prepare vessel-specific Mayday card with all permanent information
