# SKILL: Moire Lights and Special Pilotage Aids (SKILL_83)

## Description
Identify and use Moire lights for precise bridge and entrance alignment, understanding their unique visibility characteristics and directional indicators.

## Prerequisites
- Leading Lines and Transit Navigation (SKILL_79)

## Learning Objectives
- Identify Moire light chart symbols
- Use Moire lights for precise heading maintenance
- Interpret Moire light directional indicators
- Apply Moire light limitations
- Locate Moire light information in almanacs

**Moire Light Characteristics**
**Definition:** A light visible only from a specific narrow angle, typically used at bridge or marina entrances to ensure vessels stay on correct approach track.

**Physical Principle**
- **Narrow Sector:** Light beam focused in precise direction
- **Visibility Window:** Only visible when vessel is on correct heading
- **Alignment Aid:** Acts as precise transit line indicator

**Chart Symbol Representation**
- **Standard Symbol:** Shown on charts with specific notation
- **Almanac Reference:** Detailed information in relevant almanac pages
  - **Example:** St Kilda Moire light on page 85 of RYA Almanac
- **Directional Information:** May include arrows showing safe approach direction

**On-Water Appearance**
**Normal Operation:** Steady light visible when on track
**Off-Track Indications:**
- **Light Extinguishes:** Goes completely dark when vessel strays
- **Color Change:** Shifts to different color (e.g., red or green)
- **Directional Arrows:** Shows arrows indicating direction to turn to regain track
  - **Arrow Direction:** Points toward safe heading correction
  - **Visual Feedback:** Real-time steering guidance

**Common Locations**
- **Bridge Entrances:** Ensures vessels align with safe span
- **Marina Approaches:** Guides through narrow fairways
- **Port Entries:** Maintains vessels in dredged channels
- **Hazard Avoidance:** Keeps traffic clear of obstructions

**Advantages Over Standard Transits**
- **Single Object:** Only need to watch one light, not two marks
- **Night Operation:** Effective when visual transits impossible
- **Precision:** Very narrow angle provides accurate alignment
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Immediate indication of heading deviation

**Operational Technique**
1. **Approach:** Navigate toward Moire light location
2. **Acquisition:** Establish light in view on correct bearing
3. **Monitoring:** Keep light visible continuously
4. **Correction:** If light changes or extinguishes, turn toward last known safe heading
5. **Reference:** Use arrows or color changes to guide correction

**Chart Information Interpretation**
- **Symbol without Arrows:** Basic Moire light (e.g., St Kilda example)
- **Symbol with Arrows:** Shows directional guidance capability
- **Light Characteristics:** May include specific light sequences in addition to directional feature

**Integration with Other Aids**
- **Primary Use:** Precise final approach alignment
- **Supplementary:** Combine with depth monitoring and other marks
- **Not Standalone:** Should be part of comprehensive pilotage plan
- **Verification:** Cross-check with GPS position when available

**Limitations and Cautions**
- **Narrow Margin:** Small deviation causes loss of light
- **Backup Required:** Should not be only navigation method
- **Visibility Range:** Typically short-range (harbor entrance scale)
- **Power Failure:** Light loss could indicate outage, not just off-track
- **Environmental:** Heavy rain or fog may affect visibility

## Common Errors
- Assuming Moire light is malfunctioning when it extinguishes (may be off-track)
- Relying solely on Moire light without backup navigation methods
- Not consulting almanac for specific operational details
- Misinterpreting directional arrows (turning wrong way)
- Approaching at wrong angle, never acquiring light initially

## Assessment
- Identify Moire light symbol on chart or in almanac
- Describe corrective action when light extinguishes during approach
- Interpret directional arrow indicators
- Integrate Moire light into pilotage plan for bridge transit
- Explain why Moire light provides more precise alignment than standard transits
