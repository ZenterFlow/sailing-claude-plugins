# SKILL: GPS/GNSS Fundamentals and Accuracy

## Description
Understand how GPS/GNSS systems derive position from satellite signals, interpret accuracy metrics, and identify factors affecting fix quality.

## Prerequisites
- Basic position fixing concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Explain how 4 satellites provide 3D position fix
- Define HDOP and interpret accuracy implications
- Identify optimal aerial placement to minimize signal bounce
- Recognize that GPS accuracy is 95% within 15m
- Understand waypoint entry errors as primary navigation risk

## Key Concepts
**Satellite System:**
- 24 satellites in 10,900 mile orbits
- 4 satellites required for 3D fix (latitude, longitude, altitude)
- Ground stations update satellite information
- Multiple systems available: GPS (US), Galileo (EU), Glonass (RU), Beidou (CN)

**Accuracy Metrics:**
- **HDOP (Horizontal Dilution of Precision):** Smaller number = better geometry
- Theoretical best HDOP: 1.4
- Practical reliable maximum: 3-4
- More satellites = better accuracy (like multiple position lines)

**Error Sources:**
- Time calculation errors
- Signal bounce (multipath) from aerial placement
- Shielding from metal objects, structures
- Incorrect waypoint entry (most common error)

**Best Practices:**
- Aerial sited low to avoid signal bounce
- Clear view of sky, minimal obstructions
- Always plot waypoints on paper chart to verify
- Waypoint accuracy only as good as data entered

## Common Errors
- Placing aerial where signals are shielded
- Accepting high HDOP values without question
- Not verifying waypoints on chart
- Relying solely on GPS without cross-checks

## Assessment
- Explain why 4 satellites are needed for 3D fix
- Interpret HDOP values: 1.5 (good), 8.0 (poor)
- Identify optimal and poor aerial locations on vessel diagram
- Demonstrate waypoint verification process
- Explain why GPS is 95% accurate (not 100%)
