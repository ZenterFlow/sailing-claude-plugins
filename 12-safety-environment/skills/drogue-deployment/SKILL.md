# Emergency Sea Anchor and Drogue Deployment

## Purpose
Deploy drogues and sea anchors to control vessel motion during engine failure, strong wind conditions, or to stabilize life rafts and MOB recovery equipment in emergency situations.

## Description
This skill covers drogue types and applications, deployment procedures for stern drogues and sea anchors, life raft/MOB drogues, strong wind preparation, and safe retrieval techniques.

## Activation Triggers
Use this skill when you need to:
- Deploy drogue from stern to slow vessel when running downwind
- Stream sea anchor from bow to hold vessel into sea conditions
- Attach drogues to life rafts and life rings
- Determine when drogue use is beneficial during strong weather
- Prepare vessel and crew for heavy weather

## Behaviour

### Drogue Types and Applications

**Sea Anchor (Large Drogue):**
- **Purpose:** Hold vessel bow into wind and waves, reducing drift
- **Deployment:** Stream from bow with bridle to both bow cleats
- **Rode Length:** Use minimum 10x water depth for scope
- **Conditions:** Engine failure, lying to heavy weather, waiting for assistance

**Stern Drogue (Brake):**
- **Purpose:** Slow vessel when running too fast downwind
- **Deployment:** Stream from stern on strong rode
- **Adjustable Types:** Can regulate drag amount based on sea conditions
- **Benefit:** Prevents broaching by controlling speed

**Life Raft Drogues:**
- **Small Drogues:** Attached to life raft stability lines
- **Function:** Reduce leeway and improve stability in waves
- **Deployment:** Automatic on some rafts, manual on others
- **Importance:** Prevents raft capsizing and drift away from rescue

**Life Ring Drogues:**
- **Very Small Drogues:** Attached to MOB rings
- **Function:** Prevent ring blowing away from person in water
- **Essential:** In windy conditions, light rings drift faster than swimmer

### Deployment Procedures

**Stern Drogue Deployment (Running Downwind):**
1. **Secure Rode:** Attach to primary winch or strong point
2. **Check for Obstructions:** Ensure clear path over stern
3. **Lower Gradually:** Pay out rode while vessel is moving slowly
4. **Set Scope:** Use 5:1 ratio for braking effect
5. **Secure:** Make fast to winch or cleat with shock-absorbing snubber
6. **Monitor:** Watch for chafe and adjust as necessary

**Sea Anchor Deployment (Bow-To-Wind):**
1. **Rig Bridle:** Attach rode to both bow cleats forming V-shape
2. **Secure Below:** Attach trip line to retrieve from deck
3. **Launch:** Lower over bow while vessel head-to-wind
4. **Pay Out Scope:** Minimum 10:1 ratio for holding power
5. **Secure on Deck:** Use chain stopper or winch
6. **Set Drift Alarm:** Monitor GPS anchor alarm for drag

### Strong Wind Preparation with Drogue

**Pre-Weather Checklist:**
1. **Crew Preparation:** All crew in warm waterproof gear with life jackets
2. **Harness On:** Clip on harness lines before deploying drogue
3. **Reef Sails:** Reduce sail area BEFORE conditions become severe
4. **Close Hatches:** Secure all openings against water ingress
5. **Stow Loose Gear:** Secure everything on deck and below
6. **Food/Drinks:** Prepare hot drinks and easy meals
7. **Anti-Seasickness:** Consider medication for crew prone to sickness

**Drogue Decision Factors:**
- **Wind Force:** F7+ on sailing vessels, F6+ on motor vessels
- **Sea State:** Breaking waves or confused sea conditions
- **Speed Control:** Vessel running too fast downwind for safe handling
- **Engine Failure:** Need to maintain position or slow drift
- **Crew Fatigue:** Reduce motion to allow rest

### Drogue Retrieval

1. **Head to Drogue:** Manoeuvre vessel to reduce load on rode
2. **Trip Line:** Use trip line if fitted to collapse drogue
3. **Winch In:** Use winch or haul by hand if load is reduced
4. **Avoid Propeller:** Keep rode clear of prop during retrieval
5. **Stow:** Rinse with fresh water and dry before stowing

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Deploying drogue too late after conditions become severe
- Using inadequate rode length (insufficient scope)
- Attaching drogue to weak points not designed for load
- Failing to use bridle for sea anchor (causes yawing)
- Not clearing foredeck before deployment in rough conditions
- Forgetting to attach drogue to life raft after launching
- Deploying from stern when bow-to-sea is more appropriate

## Assessment Criteria

Competency demonstrated by:
- Identifying situations requiring drogue deployment
- Demonstrating proper bridle rigging for sea anchor
- Calculating required rode length for 50m depth sea anchor deployment
- Showing correct attachment point on life ring for drogue
- Explaining difference between drogue and sea anchor applications
- Executing deployment sequence for stern drogue in simulated strong wind
- Demonstrating safe retrieval technique minimizing crew risk
