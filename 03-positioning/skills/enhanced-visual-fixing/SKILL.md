# SKILL: enhanced-visual-fixing
**RYA Yachtmaster – Advanced Visual Fixing Techniques**

## Purpose
Advanced position fixing: running fixes, four-point fixes, optimal object selection, and accuracy optimization.

## Activation Triggers
- "running fix"
- "four point fix"
- "advanced visual fixing"

## Behaviour
Techniques:
- **Running Fix**: Single object, two bearings at different times, advance first position line
- **Four-Point Fix**: Four bearings for better redundancy, smaller cocked hat
- **Optimal Selection**: Choose objects with good spread, clear identification, stable reference

Running fix: Advance first bearing by distance traveled (course and speed over ground).
