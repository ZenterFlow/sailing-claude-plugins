## Purpose

Evaluate factors when deciding whether to continue navigation into port or stand off and wait for conditions to improve in fog or restricted visibility. This skill provides a comprehensive decision-making framework for one of the most critical safety decisions in navigation.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you:
- Face a decision to continue or wait in fog
- Ask about factors for restricted visibility navigation
- Need to assess harbor entry in poor visibility
- Inquire about stand-off strategies
- Want guidance on safe fog navigation decisions

## Behavior

### Decision Framework

**Continue Navigation IF:**
- **Equipment:** Radar working well, plotter verified, depth sounder reliable
- **Harbor:** Simple entrance, no complex obstacles, good radar targets
- **Traffic:** Low density, minimal collision risk
- **Visibility:** Some visibility (>0.25 mile), improving trend
- **Crew:** Experienced, rested, proficient with radar
- **Plan:** Safe route identified, contingencies prepared
- **Depth:** Adequate water throughout, good margin

**Stand Off / Wait IF:**
- **Equipment:** Radar questionable, plotter not verified
- **Harbor:** Complex entrance, narrow channel, poor radar targets
- **Traffic:** High density, multiple vessels navigating
- **Visibility:** Very poor (<0.25 mile), deteriorating
- **Crew:** Fatigued, inexperienced with radar
- **Hazards:** Unidentified obstacles, moving hazards
- **Uncertainty:** Any doubt about safe passage

### Key Assessment Factors

I'll help you evaluate these 9 critical factors:

1. **Radar capability:** Can you identify entrance and hazards?
2. **Chart plotter accuracy:** Verified with radar overlay?
3. **Depth safety:** Is there a safe depth contour to follow?
4. **Traffic situation:** AIS/radar shows other vessels moving?
5. **Entrance complexity:** Simple vs difficult approach?
6. **Alternative options:** Safe anchorage available outside?
7. **Crew readiness:** Proficient with equipment and procedures?
8. **Visibility trend:** Improving or getting worse?
9. **Time pressure:** Is waiting until conditions improve an option?

### Stand-Off Strategy

**Find safe anchorage:** Outside channel, clear of traffic
**Monitor conditions:** Visibility, weather forecasts
**Maintain watch:** Listen for other vessels, monitor VHF
**Plan re-entry:** When conditions improve or daylight
**Consider alternatives:** Different port, wait for tug escort

### Common Sense Approach

**If in doubt, don't:** Most important rule
**Better to wait:** Than risk accident
**No shame in standing off:** Sign of good seamanship
**Pressure:** Don't let schedule override safety

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Pressuring self to continue due to schedule
❌ Underestimating difficulty of harbor entrance
❌ Over-reliance on equipment without verification
❌ Ignoring visibility trends
❌ Not identifying safe stand-off location in advance

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Evaluate scenario and recommend continue/stand off
- Identify 8 factors in decision-making process
- Assess harbor entrance difficulty from chart
- Determine safe stand-off position
- Explain decision to examiner with justification
