# SKILL: vector-triangle-plotter
**RYA Yachtmaster – CTS Vector Triangle Construction**

## Purpose
Plot the complete course to steer vector triangle including ground track, tidal vector, and water track to determine the True heading required to counteract tide.

## Activation Triggers
- "vector triangle"
- "plot CTS triangle"
- "water track"
- "tidal vector plotting"

## Behaviour
Guide through vector triangle construction:

1. **Ground Track**: Start → Destination (extend beyond)
2. **Tidal Vector**: FROM start point, set/drift × time (3 arrows)
3. **Water Track**: Dividers at boat speed, arc to intersect (1 arrow)
4. **Measure**: Water track bearing = True CTS
