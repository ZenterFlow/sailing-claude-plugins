# SKILL: Admiralty List of Lights and Navigation Data (SKILL_76)

## Description
Locate, interpret, and maintain information from the Admiralty List of Lights and other navigation publications for safe passage planning and execution.

## Prerequisites
- Navigation Light Characteristics (SKILL_73)
- Light Ranges and Radar Beacons (SKILL_74)

## Learning Objectives
- Extract key information from Admiralty List of Lights
- Identify alternative light information sources
- Apply correction procedures using Notices to Mariners
- Interpret range and structure data
- Use almanac supplementary information

**Admiralty List of Lights:**
Comprehensive worldwide reference in multiple volumes, also available in digital format. More detailed than almanacs.

**Key Information Per Light:**
- **Reference Number:** Unique identifier
- **Name and Location:** Official name and geographic position
- **Position:** Lat/Long coordinates
- **Characteristic:** Light sequence pattern (e.g., Fl(3)WRG.10s)
- **Height:** Height of light above datum (meters)
- **Range:** Nominal range in nautical miles
- **Structure:** Physical description (tower, building, etc.)
- **Remarks:** Additional information (fog signals, radar, etc.)

**Information Formats:**
- **Hard Copy:** Traditional book format, requires manual updates
- **Digital Format:** Electronic versions with search capability
- **Coverage:** Worldwide in multiple geographical volumes

**Updates and Corrections:**
- **Method:** Through Notices to Mariners (weekly publications)
- **Process:** Hand-correct hard copies or update digital versions
- **Importance:** Light characteristics can change (temporarily or permanently)

**Alternative Sources:**
- **RYA Training Almanac:** Contains key lights for training areas
- **Reeds Almanac:** Popular cruising reference
- **Local Almanacs:** May have detailed regional information
- **Chart Information Boxes:** Special marks, local notes

**Electronic Charts Considerations:**
- **Appearance:** May differ between paper and electronic charts
- **Consistency:** Shapes should be similar, colors same if shown
- **Light Sequences:** Remain identical across formats
- **Example:** BYB (Black-Yellow-Black) easterly cardinal has same sequence regardless of chart type

**Supplementary Information:**
- **Sector Lights:** Show safe passage sectors with color transitions
- **Moire Lights:** Visible only from certain angle, used on bridges for alignment
  - Goes out or changes color if vessel strays off course
- **Fog Signals:** Detailed in Remarks column of List of Lights

**Practical Use:**
1. **Passage Planning:** Extract range, height, and characteristic for all critical lights
2. **Position Fixing:** Use light characteristics to verify identity when sighted
3. **Range Prediction:** Check nominal range vs expected visibility conditions
4. **Updates:** Verify latest corrections before voyage

**Example Light Entry:**
Point Victoria LH
Fl(4)WRG.15s  20m  24M

Interpretation: Group flashing 4 white/red/green every 15 seconds, 20m high, 24 mile nominal range.

## Common Errors
- Using outdated light information without checking Notices to Mariners
- Confusing nominal range with guaranteed visibility
- Overlooking Remarks column for critical fog signal information
- Assuming all light lists have same detail level as Admiralty
- Not cross-referencing chart information boxes

## Assessment
- Extract all key data from sample light entry
- Describe correction procedures for light changes
- Compare information depth across different sources
- Apply light data to passage planning scenario
- Identify critical information in Remarks column
