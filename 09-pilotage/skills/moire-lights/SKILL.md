## Purpose

Identify and use Moire lights for precise bridge and entrance alignment, understanding their unique visibility characteristics and directional indicators.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you ask about:
- Moire lights or Moire light systems
- Bridge alignment lights
- Directional or narrow sector lights
- Precise entrance alignment
- Special pilotage alignment aids

## Behavior

### Moire Light Characteristics

**Definition**: A light visible only from a specific narrow angle, typically used at bridge or marina entrances to ensure vessels stay on correct approach track

**Physical Principle**:
- Narrow sector beam focused in precise direction
- Only visible when vessel is on correct heading
- Acts as precise transit line indicator

**Purpose**: Maintains vessels in narrow safe channels or aligned with bridge spans

### Chart Symbol Representation

**Standard Symbol**: Shown on charts with specific notation

**Almanac Reference**: Detailed information in relevant almanac pages
- Example: St Kilda Moire light (RYA Almanac page 85)
- Includes operational details and characteristics

**Directional Information**: May include arrows showing safe approach direction

### On-Water Appearance

**Normal Operation**: Steady light visible when on correct track

**Off-Track Indications**:

**Light Extinguishes**:
- Goes completely dark when vessel strays off line
- Most common type of Moire light

**Color Change**:
- Shifts to different color (e.g., white → red or green)
- Color indicates direction to correct

**Directional Arrows**:
- Shows arrows indicating direction to turn
- Points toward safe heading correction
- Real-time visual feedback

### Common Locations

- **Bridge Entrances**: Ensures vessels align with safe span opening
- **Marina Approaches**: Guides through narrow fairways
- **Port Entries**: Maintains vessels in dredged channels
- **Hazard Avoidance**: Keeps traffic clear of obstructions on either side

### Advantages Over Standard Transits

**Single Object**: Only need to watch one light (not two marks)

**Night Operation**: Effective when visual day transits impossible

**Precision**: Very narrow angle provides accurate alignment (often < 1°)

**Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate indication of heading deviation

**Simplicity**: Easier to monitor than keeping two lights aligned

### Operational Technique

**Approach**:
1. Navigate toward Moire light location on charted bearing
2. Acquire light in view on correct approach bearing
3. Monitor light continuously for visibility
4. Keep light visible by maintaining heading
5. If light changes or extinguishes, correct immediately

**Correction**:
- If light disappears: Turn toward last known safe heading
- If shows directional arrows: Turn in indicated direction
- If changes color: Turn away from danger color (usually red)
- Small corrections: Make gentle adjustments

### Chart Information Interpretation

**Symbol Without Arrows**: Basic Moire light
- Light visible only on correct bearing
- Goes out if off-track
- Example: St Kilda

**Symbol With Arrows**: Shows directional guidance capability
- Arrows indicate correction direction
- More sophisticated system
- Provides steering guidance

**Light Characteristics**: May include specific light sequences in addition to directional feature

### Integration with Other Aids

**Primary Use**: Precise final approach alignment

**Supplementary**: Combine with depth monitoring and other marks

**Not Standalone**: Should be part of comprehensive pilotage plan

**Verification**: Cross-check with GPS position when available

### Limitations and Cautions

**Narrow Margin**:
- Small deviation causes loss of light
- Requires attentive helmsman
- Wind and current can push vessel off track

**Backup Required**:
- Should not be only navigation method
- Use depth and position checks
- Have contingency if light fails

**Visibility Range**:
- Typically short-range (harbor entrance scale)
- May not be visible from far offshore
- Acquire from known safe position

**Power Failure**:
- Light loss could indicate outage, not just off-track
- Check other navigation aids for confirmation
- Use alternate method if light inoperative

**Environmental**:
- Heavy rain or fog may affect visibility
- Glare from other lights can interfere
- Darkness adaptation affects acquisition

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Assuming Moire light is malfunctioning when it extinguishes (may just be off-track)
❌ Relying solely on Moire light without backup navigation methods
❌ Not consulting almanac for specific operational details
❌ Misinterpreting directional arrows (turning wrong way)
❌ Approaching at wrong angle, never acquiring light initially
❌ Over-correcting and oscillating across alignment
❌ Not accounting for tidal stream set

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Identify Moire light symbol on chart or in almanac
- Describe corrective action when light extinguishes during approach
- Interpret directional arrow indicators correctly
- Integrate Moire light into pilotage plan for bridge transit
- Explain why Moire light provides more precise alignment than standard transits
- Use Moire light with depth and position backup

### Practical Application

**Scenario**: Bridge entrance with Moire light, approach bearing 087°(M)

1. **Pre-approach**: Note Moire light on chart, bearing 087°(M)
2. **Acquisition**: Steer 087°M until light becomes visible
3. **Monitoring**: Keep light steadily visible
4. **Correction**: If light extinguishes, make small turn to reacquire
5. **Transit**: Pass through bridge maintaining light visibility
6. **Backup**: Monitor depth and GPS throughout

**Scenario**: Moire light shows red arrow pointing left

1. **Interpretation**: Turn left (port) to return to safe track
2. **Action**: Make gradual turn to port
3. **Monitor**: Watch for arrow to disappear or light to turn white
4. **Maintain**: Hold new heading keeping light centered
5. **Verify**: Check depth matches expected for channel

**Scenario**: Moire light not visible on expected bearing

1. **Check position**: Verify location with GPS
2. **Check charts**: Confirm correct bearing to light
3. **Alternative**: May be too far offshore for acquisition
4. **Action**: Continue on safe bearing, use backup navigation
5. **Acquire closer**: Look for light as range decreases
6. **Contingency**: If light inoperative, use alternate alignment method
