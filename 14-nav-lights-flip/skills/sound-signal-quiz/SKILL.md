# Sound Signal Quiz

## Purpose
Interactive quiz on COLREGS sound signals (Rules 32-37) including fog signals, maneuvering signals, warning signals, and attention signals. Essential for safe navigation and Yachtmaster Offshore exam preparation.

## Activation Triggers
This skill activates when users request:
- Sound signal quizzes or flashcards
- Fog signal identification practice
- Maneuvering signal questions
- COLREGS sound signal exam prep

## Behavior

### Quiz Format
Present vessel scenarios and ask for correct sound signal, or provide sound signal pattern and ask for meaning/vessel type. Use text descriptions of blast patterns (e.g., "one prolonged blast").

### Sound Signal Definitions

**Blast Durations:**
- **Short blast**: Approximately 1 second
- **Prolonged blast**: 4-6 seconds
- **Rapid ringing**: Continuous for approximately 5 seconds

**Signal Intervals:**
- **Fog signals (underway)**: Every 2 minutes maximum
- **Anchor signals**: Every 1 minute maximum
- **Maneuvering signals**: As needed when maneuvering

### Fog Signals (Rule 35) - Every 2 Minutes

**Power-Driven Vessels:**
- **Making way**: One prolonged blast
- **Stopped** (not making way): Two prolonged blasts in succession
- **Exam Critical**: "Making way" means moving through water, not just engine running

**Sailing Vessels:**
- **Under sail**: One prolonged + two short blasts
- **Note**: Even if engine installed, if under sail alone, use sailing signal

**Not Under Command / Restricted in Ability to Maneuver:**
- **Signal**: One prolonged + two short blasts
- **Same as**: Sailing vessel (easy to remember)
- **Applies**: Whether making way or not

**Vessel Engaged in Towing or Pushing:**
- **Signal**: One prolonged + two short blasts
- **Note**: Same as NUC/RAM (pattern of three)

**Fishing Vessels:**
- **Signal**: One prolonged + two short blasts
- **Same as**: Sailing, NUC, RAM, towing

**Constrained by Draft (CBD):**
- **Signal**: One prolonged blast (if making way) OR two prolonged (if stopped)
- **Key Point**: Uses POWER-DRIVEN signals (NOT NUC/RAM pattern)
- **Common Mistake**: Thinking CBD uses 1 prolonged + 2 short

**At Anchor (Rule 35g):**
- **Under 100m**: Rapid ringing of bell forward for 5 seconds, every 1 minute
- **Over 100m**: Bell forward + gong aft, every 1 minute
- **Additional**: May sound one short + one prolonged + one short to warn approaching vessels
- **Interval Critical**: Every 1 minute (NOT 2 minutes like underway signals)

**Vessel Aground:**
- **Signal**: Three separate distinct strokes on bell BEFORE and AFTER rapid ringing
- **Pattern**: 3 strokes → 5 sec rapid ring → 3 strokes
- **Frequency**: Every 1 minute
- **Over 100m**: Also sound gong aft

**Pilot Vessel on Duty:**
- **Fog signal**: Standard for type (power-driven or sailing)
- **Identification signal**: Four short blasts (when needed)
- **Note**: Four short blasts = pilot identification, not regular fog signal

### Maneuvering & Warning Signals (Rule 34) - In Sight of One Another

**Course Alteration Signals:**
- **One short blast**: "I am altering my course to starboard"
- **Two short blasts**: "I am altering my course to port"
- **Three short blasts**: "I am operating astern propulsion" (going backwards)
- **Exam Note**: These signal INTENT or ACTION, used when vessels in sight

**Overtaking Signals (Narrow Channel):**
- **Two prolonged + one short**: "I intend to overtake you on your starboard side"
- **Two prolonged + two short**: "I intend to overtake you on your port side"
- **One prolonged + one short + one prolonged + one short**: "Agreement - you may overtake"

**Danger / Doubt Signal:**
- **Five or more short rapid blasts**: "I do not understand your intentions" or "Danger"
- **Also allowed**: Five short + five short flashes (light signal)
- **Common usage**: Warning signal when collision risk unclear

**Approaching Blind Bend:**
- **One prolonged blast**: Warning when approaching bend or obstruction
- **Response**: Vessel around bend sounds one prolonged blast

**Leaving Berth/Dock:**
- **One prolonged blast**: Warning to other vessels
- **Common usage**: Departure signal

### Special Signals

**Vessel <12m Length:**
- **Fog signals**: May use any "efficient sound signal" (whistle, horn, mouth horn)
- **Not required**: Ship's whistle/bell if not fitted
- **Practical**: Handheld foghorn acceptable

**Vessels at Anchor Warning:**
- **Optional signal**: One short + one prolonged + one short
- **Purpose**: Warn approaching vessel of anchor position
- **Usage**: When detecting vessel approaching too close

### Quiz Examples

**Example Question 1:**
*"You are navigating in fog and hear one prolonged blast every 2 minutes. What type of vessel is this?"*

A) Power-driven vessel making way
B) Power-driven vessel stopped
C) Sailing vessel
D) Vessel not under command

**Answer**: A - Power-driven vessel making way (one prolonged = power making way)

**Example Question 2:**
*"You are a sailing vessel (engine off) in fog. What signal do you sound every 2 minutes?"*

A) One prolonged blast
B) Two prolonged blasts
C) One prolonged + two short blasts
D) Rapid ringing of bell

**Answer**: C - One prolonged + two short blasts (sailing vessel signal)

**Example Question 3:**
*"You are overtaking a vessel in a narrow channel. You wish to pass on their starboard side. What signal do you sound?"*

A) One short blast
B) Two short blasts
C) Two prolonged + one short blast
D) Two prolonged + two short blasts

**Answer**: C - Two prolonged + one short blast (overtake on target's starboard side)

**Example Question 4:**
*"You hear five short rapid blasts from a nearby vessel. What does this mean?"*

A) Vessel is altering course to starboard
B) Danger signal - unclear intentions
C) Vessel is operating astern propulsion
D) Vessel is leaving berth

**Answer**: B - Danger/doubt signal (five or more short rapid blasts)

**Example Question 5:**
*"A vessel at anchor (under 100m) sounds its fog signal every how many minutes?"*

A) Every 30 seconds
B) Every 1 minute
C) Every 2 minutes
D) Every 5 minutes

**Answer**: B - Every 1 minute (anchor signals every 1 min, underway signals every 2 min)

**Example Question 6:**
*"A vessel constrained by draft (CBD) making way in fog sounds what signal?"*

A) One prolonged blast
B) One prolonged + two short blasts
C) Two prolonged blasts
D) Three prolonged blasts

**Answer**: A - One prolonged blast (CBD uses power-driven signals, NOT NUC/RAM pattern)

### Common Exam Mistakes to Test

1. **Anchor Signal Interval**: Every 1 minute (NOT 2 minutes)
2. **CBD Fog Signal**: Same as power-driven (NOT same as NUC/RAM)
3. **Stopped vs Making Way**: Two prolonged (stopped) vs one prolonged (making way)
4. **Sailing vs Power**: One prolonged + two short (sailing) vs one prolonged (power making way)
5. **Aground Bell Pattern**: Three strokes BEFORE and AFTER rapid ringing
6. **Overtaking Signals**: Two prolonged + number of short (target side)
7. **Pilot Identification**: Four short blasts (special signal, not regular fog signal)

### Memory Aids

- **"One Long Alone, Power's Tone"** (1 prolonged = power making way)
- **"Two Long and Done, Stopped by None"** (2 prolonged = power stopped)
- **"Long-Short-Short, Sail Resort"** (1 prolonged + 2 short = sailing, NUC, RAM, fishing)
- **"Five Fast Beeps, Danger Keeps"** (5+ short = danger signal)
- **"Anchor Rings Every Single Minute"** (anchor = 1 min interval, not 2)
- **"Three-Ring-Three, Stuck Aground You'll Be"** (aground bell pattern)

### Sound Pattern Notation

**In quiz, use clear text format:**
- **●** = Short blast (1 sec)
- **━** = Prolonged blast (4-6 sec)
- **●●●●●** = Rapid short blasts (5+)
- **🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔** = Rapid bell ringing (5 sec)

**Example Patterns:**
- Power making way: **━** (every 2 min)
- Power stopped: **━ ━** (every 2 min)
- Sailing/NUC/RAM: **━ ● ●** (every 2 min)
- Danger signal: **●●●●●+**
- Altering to starboard: **●**
- Altering to port: **●●**
- Astern propulsion: **●●●**

### Quiz Flow

1. **Present Scenario**: Describe vessel situation or sound pattern
2. **Multiple Choice**: 4 options including common mistakes
3. **Accept Answer**: User selects A/B/C/D
4. **Provide Feedback**: Correct answer + explanation + interval/duration
5. **Track Score**: Running total and weak areas
6. **Continue**: Next question or exam simulation

### Difficulty Levels

**Basic:**
- Power-driven making way (1 prolonged)
- Altering course signals (1, 2, or 3 short)
- Anchor signal (bell every 1 minute)

**Intermediate:**
- Sailing vs power-driven in fog
