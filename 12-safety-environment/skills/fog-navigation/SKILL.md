# Restricted Visibility Navigation and Radar Reflector Deployment

## Purpose
Navigate safely when caught in fog or restricted visibility by applying systematic procedures, deploying radar reflectors correctly, and using all available means to detect and avoid other vessels while maintaining safe speed.

## Description
This skill covers fog encounter procedures, crew and equipment readiness, safe speed determination, radar reflector deployment (fixed vs collapsible), radar operation, auditory detection, and sound signal requirements.

## Activation Triggers
Use this skill when you need to:
- Implement fog navigation procedures
- Deploy radar reflectors for maximum effectiveness
- Apply safe speed determination factors
- Coordinate visual, radar, and auditory detection methods
- Execute proper fog signal procedures

## Behaviour

### Fog Encounter Procedures

**Immediate Actions (Within First 2 Minutes):**
1. **Establish Position:** Fix position on chart with GPS lat/long
2. **Don Life Jackets:** All crew put on life jackets immediately
3. **Deploy Radar Reflector:** If not already rigged, deploy immediately
4. **Navigation Lights:** Turn on (steaming light, bow lights, stern light)
5. **Reduce Speed:** Slow to safe speed where you can stop in half visible distance
6. **Sound Fog Signals:** Appropriate signal for vessel type and motion

**Crew and Equipment Readiness:**
7. **Extra Lookouts:** Post additional crew to watch for lights/sounds
8. **Engine Readiness:** Consider starting engine for maneuverability
9. **Wake Crew:** Wake crew in fore cabin (collision risk highest forward)
10. **Dinghy/Life Raft:** Have ready for immediate launch if collision imminent
11. **White Flare:** Keep handheld white flare ready for close-quarters warning

**Navigation and Detection:**
12. **Instrument Use:** GPS, echo sounder, VHF all used to full capability
13. **Radar Operation:** If fitted, use properly to detect other vessels
14. **VHF Monitoring:** Listen for fog signals and vessel traffic reports
15. **Depth Sounding:** Monitor depth to stay in safe water and detect shallowing

**Diversion Decision Factors:**
- **Safe Anchorage Available:** If nearby anchorage known, consider waiting out fog
- **Shallow Water Option:** Making for shallow water may put you clear of shipping
- **Traffic Density:** In heavy traffic areas, anchoring may be safer than proceeding
- **Duration:** If forecast shows fog clearing in 1-2 hours, waiting may be prudent
- **Crew Fatigue:** Long fog transit is extremely fatiguing - consider rest

### Safe Speed Determination (Rule 6 Applied to Fog)

**Visual Range Method:**
- Speed where you can stop vessel within half the distance of visible horizon
- Example: If visibility 50m, speed should allow stop within 25m
- Consider vessel's displacement and reverse thrust capability

**Traffic Density Adjustment:**
- **High Density:** Reduce speed further to assess each vessel
- **Open Water:** Can maintain moderate speed with radar/AIS
- **Narrow Channels:** Bare steerageway only

### Radar Reflector Deployment

**Fixed Reflector:**
- **Design:** Solid plastic/metal construction, permanently mounted high on mast
- **Advantage:** Always deployed, no action required in emergency
- **Performance:** Superior to collapsible - always working at full efficiency
- **Placement:** As high as practicable on mast (above 4m if possible)

**Collapsible Reflector:**
- **Design:** Folds flat for storage, opens to octahedral shape
- **Advantage:** Lower cost, removable when not needed
- **Disadvantage:** Must be deployed manually, may be forgotten
- **Performance:** Good but less effective than fixed equivalent size

**Material-Specific Requirements:**
- **GRP/Wood/Carbon Fiber:** DO NOT reflect radar waves - MUST have radar reflector
- **Steel Hulls:** Do reflect radar but deployment recommended for extra security

**Mounting for Maximum Effectiveness:**
- **Height:** As large as possible and fitted as high as possible
- **Orientation:** Ensure reflector can rotate freely to present all angles
- **Avoid Obstruction:** Keep clear of masthead instruments that could shadow

### Radar Operation in Fog

**Target Acquisition:**
- **Range Scale:** Start with 3-mile range, adjust as needed
- **Gain Setting:** Tune to show weak targets without excessive clutter
- **Sea Clutter:** Reduce to filter wave returns but not small vessels
- **Rain Clutter:** Use as needed in precipitation

**Target Assessment:**
- **Plotting:** Use ARPA or manual plotting to determine CPA/TCPA
- **Closest Point of Approach:** Any target with CPA < 0.5nm requires monitoring
- **Time to CPA:** TCPA < 10 minutes = immediate action required
- **Course Changes:** If target's relative bearing stays constant = risk of collision

### Sound Signal Requirements (Rule 35)

**Power-Driven Vessel Underway:**
- **Making Way:** 1 prolonged blast (4-6 seconds) every 2 minutes
- **Stopped:** 2 prolonged blasts every 2 minutes

**Sailing Vessel Underway:**
- **All Conditions:** 1 prolonged + 2 short blasts every 2 minutes

**Vessel at Anchor:**
- **Rapid Bell:** 5 seconds rapid ringing of bell forward

**Vessel Aground:**
- **Bell + Gong:** 3 distinct strokes on bell before and after rapid bell

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Forgetting to deploy radar reflector (especially GRP/wooden vessels)
- Not reducing speed sufficiently for visibility conditions
- Failing to post extra lookouts relying only on radar
- Using wrong fog signal for vessel type/motion
- Opening hatches for ventilation before checking for nearby vessel sounds
- Anchoring in shipping channel because "it's foggy"
- Not waking off-watch crew, creating single-point-of-failure

## Assessment Criteria

Competency demonstrated by:
- Demonstrating immediate fog actions sequence within 3 minutes
- Deploying radar reflector and explaining why GRP vessels require it
- Making appropriate fog signal for sailing vessel underway
- Calculating safe speed based on 30m visibility and vessel stopping distance
- Interpreting radar screen showing target with constant bearing and decreasing range
- Explaining why cannot rely on "yacht has right of way over power" in fog
- Showing VHF Channel 16 monitoring while simultaneously operating radar
