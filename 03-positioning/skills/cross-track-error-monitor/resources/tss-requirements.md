# TSS Navigation Requirements

## Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS)

### What is a TSS?
Designated sea lanes where traffic is organized to reduce collision risk in busy waters.

### Key Components
- **Traffic Lanes**: One-way routes (typically 1-2 nm wide)
- **Separation Zone**: Area between opposing lanes (typically 0.5-1 nm)
- **Inshore Traffic Zone**: Inside TSS, for local traffic

### COLREGS Requirements (Rule 10)
1. **Stay in correct lane** (follow traffic flow direction)
2. **Navigate in general direction of traffic** (within ~30° of lane direction)
3. **Keep clear of separation zone** (unless crossing or emergency)
4. **Avoid crossing lanes** (if must cross, do so at right angles)
5. **Small vessels**: Use inshore traffic zone when practical

### Major TSS Examples

| TSS | Location | Lanes | Width | Direction |
|-----|----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Dover Strait | English Channel | NE/SW | 1.5nm each | 045°/225°T |
| Casquets | Channel Islands | N/S | 2.0nm each | 000°/180°T |
| Ushant | W France | N/S, E/W | 2.5nm | Various |
| Land's End | SW England | E/W | 1.5nm each | 080°/260°T |

### XTE Limits in TSS

**Recommended XTE Limits**:
- **Ideal**: ±0.1 nm from lane centerline (±200m)
- **Acceptable**: ±0.25 nm (±500m)
- **Maximum**: Stay within lane boundaries

**Lane Width 1.5 nm Example**:
```
        Separation Zone
              │
 ─────────────┼─────────────
              │
    Lane A    │    Lane B
   (1.5 nm)   │   (1.5 nm)
              │
  Centerline  │  Centerline
      │       │       │
 ─────┼───────┼───────┼─────
      │               │
    +0.75nm         +0.75nm
    from edge       from edge
```

**Critical**: If XTE reaches lane edge (0.75nm in example above), you're exiting lane = DANGER

### Monitoring Frequency

| Situation | XTE Check Interval |
|-----------|-------------------|
| TSS Entry | Every 5 minutes |
| Mid-TSS | Every 10 minutes |
| TSS Exit | Every 5 minutes |
| Poor visibility | Every 2-3 minutes |
| Heavy traffic | Continuous |

### XTE Correction in TSS

**Small XTE (<0.2 nm)**:
- Alter course 3-5° toward track
- Monitor for 15-30 minutes
- Adjust as needed

**Medium XTE (0.2-0.4 nm)**:
- Alter course 5-10° toward track
- Monitor closely (every 5 mins)
- May need to parallel track if traffic prevents crossing

**Large XTE (>0.4 nm, near edge)**:
- URGENT correction needed
- Alter course 10-15° toward track
- Consider traffic implications
- May need to exit lane and re-enter safely

### VHF Monitoring
- **Ch 16**: International distress and calling
- **Local traffic**: Dover (Ch 11, 12), Casquets (Ch 13, 80), etc.
- Listen for traffic reports and separation zone warnings
