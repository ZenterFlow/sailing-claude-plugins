# SKILL: Mercator Projection Chart Navigation

## Description
Understand Mercator projection principles and correctly measure distances accounting for latitude scale variation.

## Prerequisites
- Latitude/Longitude fundamentals (SKILL_17)

## Learning Objectives
- Explain why latitude scale elongates at higher latitudes
- Demonstrate correct distance measurement technique using local latitude scale
- Identify distortion effects on land mass representation
- Determine appropriate latitude scale band for measurement

## Key Concepts
**Scale Variation:**
- Latitude scale increases exponentially toward poles
- Greenland appears ~same size as Africa (actual 1:13 ratio)
- Scale becomes infinite at poles (projection limitation)

**Measurement Rules:**
- ALWAYS use latitude scale at SAME latitude as measurement area
- NEVER use longitude scale for distance
- For long distances: measure at mid-latitude or segment the measurement

**Transverse Mercator:**
- Cylinder axis in equatorial plane
- Central meridian line of tangency
- Highly accurate within ±15° of central meridian
- Ideal for harbor charts and river estuaries

## Common Errors
- Using wrong latitude scale (off by 1° = 60 NM error)
- Measuring distance on longitude scale
- Forgetting scale expansion in polar regions

## Assessment
- Measure 5 distances on RYA Chart 3 with &lt;0.5 NM error
- Explain why 100 NM measurement at 60°N requires different scale than at 30°N
