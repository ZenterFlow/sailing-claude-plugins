## Tidal Terminology Definitions (Exam Standard)

### Primary Reference Planes

#### Chart Datum (CD)
**Definition**: The reference plane from which all charted depths and drying heights are measured.

**Key Points**:
- Set at approximately LAT (Lowest Astronomical Tide) in UK waters
- ZERO point for all vertical measurements on charts
- Water level rarely falls below Chart Datum
- Used worldwide but specific level varies by region

**Practical Use**:
- All blue depth numbers on charts are below CD
- All underlined drying heights are above CD
- Tide predictions give "height above CD"

**Example**: "Charted depth 8.5m" means 8.5 meters below Chart Datum

---

#### Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT)
**Definition**: The highest level which can be predicted to occur under average meteorological conditions and any combination of astronomical conditions.

**Key Points**:
- Excludes storm surge and other weather effects
- Occurs during maximum perigean spring tides
- Provides safety margin for overhead clearances
- Typically 0.5-1.0m above MHWS

**Practical Use**:
- Bridge clearances on modern charts
- Overhead cable clearances
- Maximum water level for planning

**Example**: "Bridge clearance 22m" usually means 22m above HAT

---

#### Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT)
**Definition**: The lowest level which can be predicted to occur under average meteorological conditions and any combination of astronomical conditions.

**Key Points**:
- Approximately equals Chart Datum in UK waters
- Provides safety margin for minimum depths
- Occurs during minimum apogean spring tides
- Water rarely falls below this level

**Practical Use**:
- Basis for Chart Datum
- Minimum water level for planning
- Guarantees charted depths are available

**Example**: CD ≈ LAT, so charted depths are nearly always covered

---

### Mean Tidal Levels

#### Mean High Water Springs (MHWS)
**Definition**: The average height of two successive high waters during spring tides over a 19-year period.

**Key Points**:
- Average of spring tide high waters only
- Calculated over 18.6-year Metonic cycle
- Typically 0.5-1.0m below HAT
- Used for land survey datum

**Practical Use**:
- Light and landmark elevations
- Heights of features on land
- Some older charts use for bridge clearances

**Example**: "Light 25m" means 25m above MHWS

---

#### Mean Low Water Springs (MLWS)
**Definition**: The average height of two successive low waters during spring tides over a 19-year period.

**Key Points**:
- Average of spring tide low waters only
- Typically 0.5-1.0m above LAT
- Lower than MLWN but higher than LAT
- Used for tidal range calculations

**Practical Use**:
- Spring range = MHWS - MLWS
- Minimum water during spring tides
- Planning shallow-water passages

**Example**: MLWS of 0.8m means typical spring low tide is 0.8m above CD

---

#### Mean High Water Neaps (MHWN)
**Definition**: The average height of two successive high waters during neap tides over a 19-year period.

**Key Points**:
- Average of neap tide high waters only
- Lower than MHWS (smaller range)
- Midway between MHWS and mean sea level
- Less extreme than spring tides

**Practical Use**:
- Neap range = MHWN - MLWN
- Typical neap high water level
- Less favorable for crossing shallow bars

**Example**: MHWN of 4.2m means typical neap high tide is 4.2m above CD

---

#### Mean Low Water Neaps (MLWN)
**Definition**: The average height of two successive low waters during neap tides over a 19-year period.

**Key Points**:
- Average of neap tide low waters only
- Higher than MLWS (smaller range)
- More water than spring low tides
- Midway between MLWS and mean sea level

**Practical Use**:
- Neap range = MHWN - MLWN
- Typical neap low water level
- More favorable depths than MLWS

**Example**: MLWN of 2.2m means typical neap low tide is 2.2m above CD

---

### Tidal Range

#### Spring Range
**Definition**: The difference between MHWS and MLWS.

**Formula**: Spring Range = MHWS - MLWS

**Key Points**:
- Largest tidal range
- Occurs during spring tides (new/full moon)
- Maximum vertical movement of water
- Important for tidal stream strength

**Example**: MHWS 6.2m, MLWS 0.8m → Spring Range = 5.4m

---

#### Neap Range
**Definition**: The difference between MHWN and MLWN.

**Formula**: Neap Range = MHWN - MLWN

**Key Points**:
- Smallest tidal range
- Occurs during neap tides (quarter moon)
- Minimum vertical movement of water
- Weaker tidal streams

**Example**: MHWN 4.8m, MLWN 2.2m → Neap Range = 2.6m

---

#### Range (at specific time)
**Definition**: The difference between high water and low water for a particular tide.

**Formula**: Range = HW height - LW height (for that tide)

**Example**: HW 5.2m, LW 1.4m → Range = 3.8m

---

### Chart Markings

#### Charted Depth
**Appearance**: Blue numbers on chart (e.g., "8.5")

**Definition**: Depth below Chart Datum, always covered by water.

**Formula**: Total depth = Charted depth + Height of tide

**Example**: Charted depth 8.5m, tide 3.2m → Total depth 11.7m

---

#### Drying Height
**Appearance**: Underlined numbers on chart (e.g., "2.3")

**Definition**: Height above Chart Datum that uncovers (dries out) at low water.

**Formula**: Water depth = Height of tide - Drying height

**Example**: Drying height 2.3m, tide 4.5m → Water depth 2.2m over rock
