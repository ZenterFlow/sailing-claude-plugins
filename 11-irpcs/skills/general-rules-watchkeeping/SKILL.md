# IRPCS General Rules and Watchkeeping

## Purpose
Master the fundamental requirements for maintaining a proper lookout, understanding watchkeeping responsibilities, and applying collision avoidance rules in all conditions under IRPCS.

## Description
This skill covers the foundation of collision regulations - Rule 5 (Lookout), identifying and mitigating blind arcs, assessing risk of collision, and understanding stand-on vs give-way vessel actions. Essential for safe navigation and compliance with international regulations.

## Activation Triggers
Use this skill when you need to:
- Understand proper watchkeeping by all available means
- Identify and mitigate blind arcs on a vessel
- Assess risk of collision using bearing series
- Learn stand-on vs give-way vessel responsibilities
- Apply narrow channel rules (Rule 9)
- Understand regulatory language ("shall" vs "may")

## Behaviour

### Fundamental Watchkeeping Requirement (Rule 5)

**All Available Means:**
Rule 5 requires a watch to be kept at all times by ALL available means:
- **Visual:** Sight observation (primary method)
- **Auditory:** Listen for sound signals, engine noises, VHF communications
- **Radar:** When equipped and operational
- **Other Sensors:** AIS, depth sounder when relevant

### Blind Arc Identification and Mitigation

**Common Blind Arcs:**
Blind arcs are areas obscured from view by vessel structure or equipment:
- **Masts and Rigging:** Vertical obstructions blocking sectors
- **Sails:** Large sails (especially wrap-around headsails)
- **Cockpit Enclosures:** Dodgers, biminis, spray hoods
- **Superstructure:** Cabin, wheelhouse, equipment mounts
- **Equipment:** Radar domes, antennas, solar panels

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Physical Movement:** Actively move around cockpit to scan all sectors
- **Sail Management:** Reduce headsail size in crowded areas
- **Crew Assignment:** Post additional lookouts to cover blind sectors
- **Positioning:** Stand on deck rather than in enclosed wheelhouse
- **Regular Scanning:** Systematic 360° scan pattern every 2-3 minutes

### Risk of Collision Assessment

**"In Sight" Method:**
- **Visual Bearings:** Take series of compass bearings on approaching vessel
- **Constant Bearing:** If bearing remains constant while distance decreases = RISK EXISTS
- **Closing Rate:** Observe if vessel appears to be getting larger/closing
- **Aspect Change:** If vessel's aspect (viewed shape) doesn't change = RISK EXISTS

**"Not in Sight" Method (Restricted Visibility):**
- **Radar Monitoring:** Track targets, calculate CPA/TCPA
- **VHF Communication:** Contact vessel to ascertain intentions
- **Sound Signals:** Listen for fog signals indicating vessel presence
- **AIS Data:** Monitor vessel positions, courses, speeds

**Rule 7 - Risk of Collision:**
- **Assume Risk:** If any doubt exists, assume risk of collision exists
- **Action Required:** Take avoiding action immediately
- **Precautionary Principle:** Better to act unnecessarily than to hesitate

### Key Definitions

- **Underway:** Not aground, not attached to shore/ground (may be drifting)
- **Making Way:** Being propelled through water by engine, sail, oars, or other means
- **No Right of Way:** IRPCS gives no vessel "right of way" - all vessels have obligation to avoid collision

### Stand-On vs Give-Way Vessel Actions

**Give-Way Vessel:**
- **Early Action:** Take avoiding action well before close quarters
- **Significant Alteration:** Large course/speed change showing clear intent
- **Visibility:** Show different aspect/lights to other vessel
- **Direction:** Alter to starboard when possible (preferred action)

**Stand-On Vessel:**
- **Maintain Course:** Hold current course and speed
- **Maintain Speed:** Do NOT slow down or alter (if safe to do so)
- **Vigilance:** Monitor give-way vessel's action continuously
- **Last Resort:** When unsafe to stand on, turn away deliberately and obviously

### Regulatory Language
- **"Shall" = OBLIGATORY:** Must comply, non-negotiable requirement
- **"May" = OPTIONAL:** Permitted if it reduces collision risk

### Narrow Channel Rules (Rule 9)

**Small Craft (<20m) and Sailing Vessels:**
- **Must Not Impede:** Ships using the channel for navigation
- **Position:** Keep to starboard side of channel
- **Crossing:** Avoid crossing channel when possible
- **Anchoring:** Do not anchor in the channel

### Action When Risk of Collision Exists

- **Preferred Action:** Alter course to starboard
- **Avoid:** Altering to port (unless overtaking on port side)
- **Speed Reduction:** Come to complete stop if necessary
- **Multiple Options:** Choose action that is clearest to other vessel

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Maintaining rigid watch from single position with blind arcs
- Relying solely on radar without visual backup
- Misinterpreting constant bearing (failing to recognize risk)
- Assuming large commercial vessels will always give way
- Taking last-minute action instead of early, significant alteration
- Forgetting that "shall" means mandatory compliance
- Impeding channel traffic as small craft or sailing vessel

## Assessment Criteria

Competency demonstrated by:
- Demonstrating proper 360° lookout technique mitigating blind arcs
- Identifying risk of collision from bearing series
- Stating correct give-way vessel action for various scenarios
- Explaining when stand-on vessel must take action
- Applying "shall" vs "may" appropriately in rule interpretation
- Executing narrow channel navigation without impeding others
- Taking early and substantial avoiding action
