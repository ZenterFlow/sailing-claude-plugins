# SKILL: Integrated Electronic Navigation Systems

## Description
Use multiple electronic systems (GPS, radar, AIS, depth, log) together for navigation, understanding each system's role and cross-verifying information.

## Prerequisites
- Skills 48-54 (individual electronic systems)

## Learning Objectives
- Cross-check GPS position with radar ranges
- Verify charted depth with echo sounder
- Use log speed with SOG to identify tide/leeway
- Integrate AIS and radar for collision avoidance
- Recognize when electronic data is unreliable

## Integration Strategy
**Primary Navigation Loop:**
1. **GPS plotter:** Primary position source
2. **Radar ranges:** Verify position on charted objects
3. **Depth sounder:** Verify position on depth contours
4. **All agree:** High confidence in position
5. **Disagreement:** Investigate and resolve

**Speed Analysis:**
- **Log speed:** Speed through water
- **SOG:** Speed over ground
- **Difference:** Effect of tide + leeway
- **Application:** Identify tidal stream, estimate leeway

**Collision Avoidance Loop:**
1. **Radar:** Detect all objects (including non-AIS)
2. **AIS:** Identify vessel details, course, speed
3. **Visual:** Confirm and assess situation
4. **Integrated picture:** Best collision avoidance strategy

**Position Verification Methods:**
- **GPS fix:** Primary position
- **Radar range fix:** Ranges to 2-3 charted objects
- **Depth contour:** Sounder reading matches expected depth
- **Visual fix:** When objects visible
- **Running fix:** Single object with time interval

**System Limitations Cross-Check:**
- **GPS error:** Check radar ranges, depth, visual
- **Radar shadow:** Use visual, GPS
- **AIS not transmitting:** Use radar, visual
- **Depth false reading:** Check GPS position, deeper water

**Redundancy Principle:**
- Never rely on single system
- Always maintain paper chart plot
- Log positions regularly for DR/EP backup
- Know how to navigate if all electronics fail

## Common Errors
- Relying on single electronic system
- Not cross-checking when data seems odd
- Forgetting to log positions for backup navigation
- Ignoring depth/radar when GPS looks correct

## Assessment
- Identify discrepancy between GPS and radar range
- Demonstrate position verification using 3 methods
- Explain how log vs SOG identifies tide/leeway
- Create integrated collision avoidance assessment
- Navigate simulated electronics failure scenario
