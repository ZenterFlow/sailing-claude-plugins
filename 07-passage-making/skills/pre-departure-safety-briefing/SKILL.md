# Pre-Departure Safety Briefing and Equipment Verification

## Purpose
Master comprehensive pre-passage safety briefing delivery and systematic equipment verification procedures for all vessel types, ensuring crew awareness of emergency protocols, equipment locations, and vessel-specific safety procedures before departure.

## Description
This skill covers complete pre-departure safety procedures including life jacket inspection, flare inventory, fire extinguisher verification, gas system checks, and shore contact establishment. Essential for safe passage making and legal compliance.

## Activation Triggers
Use this skill when you need to:
- Conduct pre-departure safety brief for crew
- Verify operational readiness of safety equipment
- Inspect life jackets, flares, and fire suppression systems
- Establish shore contact and passage plan registration
- Brief crew on vessel-specific emergency procedures

## Behaviour

### Pre-Brief Equipment Inspection

**Life Jacket Check:**
- Examine for wear and tear, especially bladder folding creases
- Verify gas bottle and automatic firing unit on inflatable models
- Confirm gas bottle is correct size and rust-free
- Check crotch strap adjustment, light functionality, whistle, oral inflation tube, and reflective tape
- Ensure integral harness and spray hood are fitted where appropriate

**Flare Inventory Check:**
- Verify seal integrity on canisters (damaged seals indicate damp, useless flares)
- Confirm quantities: 4 red rocket, 4 red hand-held, 2 orange smoke, 2 white warning flares typical
- Check expiration dates and service history
- Note different manufacturer activation methods

**Fire Extinguisher Verification:**
- Inspect for annual service tags
- Check pressure gauges on dry powder units
- Test by tilting and listening for powder movement
- Confirm proper sizing for vessel compartments

**Gas System Safety Check:**
- Test shut-off valve operation in galley
- Verify gas bottles stored in external-draining locker
- Check approved hose condition and connections
- Test manual bilge pump effectiveness for gas evacuation

### Safety Brief Content Delivery

**1. Life Jacket and Harness Protocol:**
- Demonstrate proper donning and adjustment
- Identify jackstay locations (canvas straps running along side decks)
- Show harness attachment points and clip-on procedures
- Emphasize: NEVER clip to guard rails (not designed for load)
- State RYA policy: Wear at all times unless skipper exempts; mandatory for non-swimmers, night ops, fog, reefing, dinghy use

**2. Emergency Communication:**
- VHF Channel 16 operation and DSC mayday button sequence
- EPIRB/SART location and activation procedures
- Emergency VHF aerial location if available
- Personal AIS beacon operation for MOB situations

**3. Man Overboard Equipment:**
- Location and deployment of MOB equipment
- Life raft launching procedure
- Life ring drogue attachment to prevent wind drift

**4. Fire Emergency Response:**
- Fire extinguisher and blanket locations
- Engine compartment fire protocol: NEVER open engine bay (oxygen feed)
- Automatic extinguisher access hole location
- Engine fire specific actions

**5. Vessel Operations Brief:**
- Engine start procedure and spare parts location (oil, impellers, filters, belts)
- Heads operation and rules (what can/cannot be flushed)
- Galley safety: cooker operation, gas shut-off, fire blanket use
- Dinghy boarding/loading procedures and painter length limits
- Radar reflector deployment (collapsible vs fixed types)

### Shore Contact Establishment

**Information to Provide:**
- Start/end points with intermediate ports
- ETA and "latest arrival" times for each destination
- Proposed ports of refuge
- Vessel details: type, length, registration, crew number, provisions
- Safety and communication equipment inventory
- Passage plan accounting for leeway and tidal effects

**Communication Methods:**
- Radio voyage plan to coastguard (Safetrx registration scheme)
- Submit movement form to club/organization
- Use RYA Safetrx app for automated tracking
- Designate shore contact person with instructions to raise alarm if not checked in

### Pre-Departure Provisioning Verification

- Sufficient food, water, fuel (7/8 full to prevent splash-back), gas
- Warm clothing and dry bedding for all crew
- First aid kit location and inventory
- Rigging cutters accessibility

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Delivering generic brief without vessel-specific equipment locations
- Failing to physically demonstrate equipment operation during brief
- Omitting crotch strap adjustment on life jackets
- Neglecting to check flare expiration dates before departure
- Incomplete shore contact information (missing "latest arrival" time)
- Not accounting for leeway in passage plan shared with shore contacts
- Forgetting to brief crew on heads operational limits

## Assessment Criteria

Competency demonstrated by:
- Conducting complete pre-departure equipment verification checklist
- Delivering comprehensive safety brief covering all mandatory items
- Demonstrating proper life jacket inspection and fitting procedure
- Successfully registering passage plan with coastguard or designated shore contact
- Identifying and locating all fire fighting equipment with specific use cases
- Executing VHF DSC mayday test sequence (non-emergency)
