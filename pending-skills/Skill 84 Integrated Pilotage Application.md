# SKILL: Integrated Pilotage Application (SKILL_84)

## Description
Synthesize all pilotage techniques into comprehensive passage plans, applying variation, tidal calculations, and multiple navigation aids for real-world scenarios.

## Prerequisites
- Pilotage Planning Methods (SKILL_81)
- Restricted Visibility Pilotage (SKILL_82)
- Moire Lights and Special Pilotage Aids (SKILL_83)

## Learning Objectives
- Create integrated passage plans from open water to mooring
- Apply variation correctly throughout planning (6°W)
- Combine multiple techniques (transits, clearing bearings, depth contours)
- Plan night departures from anchorages
- Incorporate tidal stream and height calculations
- Execute plans with proper cockpit discipline

**Comprehensive Planning Framework**
**Part One - Open Water to Approach**
- **Starting Waypoint:** Specify exact coordinates (e.g., 46°10.89'N 006°15.15'W)
- **Route Segments:** Break into logical legs with key waypoints
- **Distance Calculations:** Overall and individual leg distances
- **Speed Selection:** Choose appropriate boat speed (6kn/12kn/18kn examples)
- **Tidal Stream:** Apply current effect to each leg
- **Passage Time:** Calculate approximate duration
- **ETA Planning:** Determine arrival time with contingency buffer

**Tidal Height Integration**
- **HOT Reference:** Calculate Height of Tide for estimated arrival
- **Contingency:** Subtract time buffer for early/late arrival
- **Minimum Depths:** Add HOT to charted depths for each leg
- **LW Check:** Verify depth at moorings on arrival and next Low Water

**Visual Verification at Waypoints**
- **Buoy Identification:** Use specific buoy numbers and characteristics
- **Back Bearings:** Plot on lights for safe passage between hazards
- **Depth Confirmation:** Expected depth at each waypoint
- **Turn Criteria:** Specific bearing or depth that triggers course change

**Hazard Avoidance Strategies**
- **Clearing Bearings:** Use for harbor entrances and narrow passages
- **Depth Contours:** Follow safe contour lines between hazards
- **Leading Lines:** Identify and use day/night transits
- **Minimum Depths:** Establish safe depth limit for each leg
- **Contingency Plans:** Alternative routes for each hazard area

**Part Two - Harbor Pilotage to Mooring**
**Visual Verification of Approach Waypoint**
- **Primary Marks:** Identify first buoy or charted feature
- **Confirmation Method:** Bearing and distance check
- **Depth Check:** Verify expected depth at waypoint

**Buoyage Navigation Through Sound**
- **Sequential Marks:** List all buoys in order with characteristics
- **Bearings:** Course between each buoy
- **Key Distances:** Distance between marks
- **Safe Depths:** Minimum depth for each channel section
- **Hazards:** Identify all obstructions near channel

**Final Approach to Moorings**
- **Mooring Depth:** Depth at visitors' moorings
- **Arrival Depth:** Water depth at estimated arrival time
- **Swing Room:** Verify adequate space for vessel
- **Holding Ground:** Confirm suitable anchoring conditions

**Standard Leg Format**
**Leg 1 Example:**
- **From:** Marina entrance or specific buoy
- **Course:** 232° magnetic (apply variation to true)
- **Distance:** 3.5 miles
- **Minimum Safe Depth:** 5 meters
- **Expected Maximum Depth:** 35 meters
- **Obstructions:** None
- **Arrival Verification:** Bearing 230°(M) from point lighthouse, expected depth 8m

**Night Departure from Anchorage**
**Visual Aid Selection:**
- **Leading Lights:** Identify if available for exit
- **Clearing Bearings:** Use entrance lights for safe departure corridor
- **Back Bearings:** Use astern bearings on lights to clear dangers
- **Linards Point Light:** Evaluate usefulness for different departure directions

**Contingency Planning**
**Northwest vs Southeast Options through Fiddler's Race:**
- **Linards Point Light:** Determine if usable for either direction
- **Alternative Marks:** Identify backup navigation aids
- **Depth Constraints:** Safe depths for each route option
- **Hazard Clearance:** Ensure dangers avoided in both directions

**Practical Example Dawson Harbour**
**Plan Components:**
1. **Leg 1:** Pick up transit 277°(M), depth not less than 5m + HOT
2. **Leg 2:** Change heading to pick up East cardinal buoy
3. **Leg 3:** Head center between Easterly and Southerly cardinals
4. **Leg 4:** Keep in deep channel between Northerly and Southerly
5. **Leg 5:** Maintain minimum 5m + HOT depth
6. **Leg 6:** Verify depth over 6m with HOT, confirm Southerly abeam
7. **Leg 7:** Stay in center channel, maintain 5m + HOT minimum
8. **Leg 8:** Approach anchorage, maintain 2m + HOT minimum
9. **Final:** Anchor and establish transit to check holding

**Plan Execution Discipline**
- **Cockpit Navigation:** Execute plan from cockpit, not below
- **Hand Bearing Compass:** Primary monitoring tool
- **Depth Sounder:** Continuous monitoring, especially near contours
- **If Lost:** Stop near buoy, re-establish position before proceeding
- **When in Doubt:** Stop vessel and fix position

**Documentation Standards**
- **Leg Numbering:** Clear sequential numbering
- **Magnetic Bearings:** All headings converted to magnetic
- **Depth Reference:** Always include + HOT notation
- **Hazard Notes:** Specific warnings for each critical area
- **Verification Points:** Clear criteria for each waypoint arrival

## Common Errors
- Failing to apply variation to all bearings
- Not including Height of Tide in depth calculations
- Creating plans too detailed to follow on deck
- Omitting visual verification points for waypoints
- Neglecting contingency plans for restricted visibility
- Poor leg numbering or unclear course instructions
- Forgetting to monitor depth continuously near hazards

## Assessment
- Create complete passage plan from open water to mooring
- Apply 6°W variation correctly throughout plan
- Calculate tidal heights for arrival and next LW
- Integrate at least three different pilotage techniques
- Execute plan in simulation with proper cockpit discipline
- Night departure plan with multiple route options
- Self-check plan against published example answers
