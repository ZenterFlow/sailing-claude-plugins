# SKILL: Navigation Web Construction

## Description
Create a pre-plotted navigation web of bearings and distance arcs from a waypoint to enable rapid position monitoring and tacking decisions.

## Prerequisites
- Chart plotting skills
- Bearing and distance measurement

## Learning Objectives
- Construct radial bearing lines from waypoint at 5° or 10° intervals
- Draw concentric distance arcs at 0.5 or 1.0 mile spacing
- Label web for quick GPS position interpretation
- Use web for tacking point determination
- Apply web for night/fog navigation

## Construction Method
**Setup:**
1. Identify destination waypoint (harbor entrance, mark, etc.)
2. Draw ground track line to waypoint (to nearest 5°)
3. Mark waypoint center clearly

**Bearing Lines:**
- Draw lines radiating from waypoint at 5° or 10° intervals
- Extend lines beyond expected approach area
- Label each line with bearing (True) from waypoint
- Cover anticipated approach sector (e.g., 80°-320°)

**Distance Arcs:**
- Using compass, draw circles at 1 mile intervals from waypoint
- Alternative: 0.5 mile intervals for close approach
- Label each arc with distance (1M, 2M, 3M, etc.)

**Usage:**
- GPS shows bearing & distance to waypoint continuously
- When reading is 050° 4.0M → position is at intersection
- No plotting needed - instant mental position fix
- For tacking: tack before reaching critical bearing

**Practical Example:**
- Northerly destination, westerly wind
- On port tack: tack before bearing &lt;320°(T)
- On starboard tack: tack before bearing &gt;050°(T)

## Common Errors
- Uneven spacing of bearings or arcs
- Not covering full approach sector
- Forgetting to label lines clearly
- Using magnetic instead of True bearings

## Assessment
- Construct complete web for sample harbor entry
- Plot 5 positions from GPS readings using web in &lt;30 seconds each
- Demonstrate tacking decision using web
- Explain time savings vs continuous plotting
