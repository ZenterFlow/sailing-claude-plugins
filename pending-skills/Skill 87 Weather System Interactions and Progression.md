# SKILL: Weather System Interactions and Progression (SKILL_87)

## Description
Analyze interactions between multiple pressure systems, predict resulting wind patterns, and track low pressure system progression through different phases.

## Prerequisites
- Global Weather Systems (SKILL_86)

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Buys Ballot's Law in practical scenarios
- Predict wind patterns between interacting systems
- Identify system interaction effects (convergence/divergence)
- Track low pressure system lifecycle
- Interpret frontal weather sequences

**System Interactions Overview**

**Two High Pressure Systems Together:**
- **Between Systems:** Winds oppose each other
- **Result:** Area of reduced wind, variable direction
- **Within Systems:** Light winds, variable in centers (Col)
- **Navigation Strategy:** Best route through center of high for lighter conditions

**High and Low Pressure Together:**
- **Between Systems:** Systems drive each other, strongest winds in "squeeze zone"
- **NH Example (Low left, High right):**
  - Left of low: Strong NNW winds
  - Center of low: Variable winds
  - East of low: Very strong SSE winds
  - South of low: Strong WSW winds
- **SH Example:** Mirror image (strong southerlies between systems)
- **Navigation Strategy:** Avoid squeeze zone between systems

**Two Low Pressure Systems Together:**
- **Between Systems:** Winds oppose, creating lighter conditions
- **Within Systems:** Stronger winds expected between warm and cold fronts
- **Navigation Strategy:** Pass between lows for lighter winds, but avoid frontal zones

**Multiple System Interactions:**
- **Pattern:** Two highs and two lows create complex wind patterns
- **Center Area:** Light variable winds (Col region)
- **Escape Routes:** Between systems = stronger winds
- **Best Route:** Straight through high for lighter conditions

**Low Pressure System Development (NH)**

**Formation Stage:**
- Warm moist air pushes into cold air along polar front
- Rising warm air creates surface pressure drop
- Initial spin begins anticlockwise (NH)

**Wave Stage:**
- Cold front and warm front develop
- "Warm sector" forms between fronts
- System deepens and matures

**Mature Depression:**
- Cold front travels faster than warm front
- Forces warm air to lift, deepening low
- Well-defined warm sector, cold front, warm front

**Weather Sequence (NH) - Straddling Warm Front:**

**Approach (A):**
- Barometer falls
- Wind initially veers then backs
- High cirrus clouds (first sign)
- Clouds thicken to altostratus then nimbostratus
- Rain begins
- Visibility deteriorates

**Warm Front Passage (A to B):**
- Heavy rain, poor visibility
- Temperature rises
- Wind veers to southwest
- Barometer steadies

**Warm Sector (B):**
- Break in rain
- Temperature warmer
- Wind west-southwest, stronger but steady
- Possible drizzle, low dense cloud, fog
- Barometer steady

**Cold Front Approach (B to C):**
- Weather deteriorates rapidly
- Strong rain, very poor visibility
- Squalls and thunderstorms common
- Unstable conditions

**Cold Front Passage (C):**
- Wind veers sharply to northwest
- Barometer rises
- Temperature falls
- Patchy blue skies with showers
- Good visibility between showers
- Gusty conditions under clouds

**Key Indicators Table:**

| Phase | Barometer | Wind | Temperature | Clouds | Precipitation | Visibility |
|-------|-----------|------|-------------|--------|---------------|------------|
| Pre-Warm Front | Falling | Veers then backs | - | Cirrus→Altostratus→Nimbostratus | Increasing | Poor |
| Warm Sector | Steady | SW, steady | Warmer | Low dense, possible fog | Drizzle | Poor to moderate |
| Pre-Cold Front | Steady/falling | - | - | Building cumulus | Increasing | Poor |
| Post-Cold Front | Rising | Veers NW | Falling | Cumulus showers | Showers | Good between showers |

**Southern Hemisphere Differences:**
- **Circulation:** Clockwise around low (opposite NH)
- **Wind Shifts:** Backing instead of veering through fronts
- **Sequence:** Mirror image but same cloud/precipitation patterns

**Barometric Pressure Monitoring**
- **Normal Trend:** Gradual changes with system movement
- **Warning Signs:**
  - &gt;6mb drop in 3 hours = Force 6 warning
  - &gt;8mb drop in 3 hours = Force 8 warning
  - Sharp rise also indicates strong winds
  - Quick rise after low = stronger blow coming

**Practical Application: Chart Analysis**
1. **Locate Systems:** Identify high and low centers
2. **Draw Wind Arrows:** Apply hemisphere circulation rules
3. **Assess Your Position:** Where are you relative to systems?
4. **Predict Movement:** Note system speed/direction from forecast
5. **Time Your Transit:** Plan to avoid worst conditions

**System Speed Definitions:**
- Slowly: 0-15 knots
- Steadily: 15-25 knots
- Rather rapidly: 25-35 knots
- Rapidly: 35-45 knots
- Very rapidly: 45+ knots

## Common Errors
- Confusing veering/backing direction through frontal passage
- Misplacing wind direction relative to low pressure center
- Forgetting that cold front moves faster than warm front
- Not accounting for squeeze zones between systems
- Ignoring barometric rate of change warnings

## Assessment
- Plot wind arrows on synoptic chart for given system configuration
- Predict wind direction/strength at specific location between systems
- Describe cloud/precipitation sequence for vessel passing through low
- Calculate expected barometric change rate and interpret
- Plan passage route avoiding strongest wind zones
