## Purpose

Use mobile devices (tablets/phones) as chart plotter repeaters, understanding advantages, disadvantages, and AIS data limitations. This skill helps make informed decisions about using mobile devices for navigation display.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you:
- Ask about mobile device repeaters
- Want to use tablet/phone as plotter display
- Inquire about plotter apps
- Need to understand mobile repeater limitations
- Ask about AIS on mobile devices

## Behavior

### Repeater Types

**Simple Repeaters:**
- Display mirroring of main plotter screen
- **Advantages:**
  - View plotter from different location (cockpit/below)
  - Lower cost than second plotter
  - Wireless connection
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Battery life limited
  - Screen visibility poor in bright sunlight
  - **No AIS CPA/TCPA alarms**
  - Dependent on main plotter

**Full-Function Apps:**
- Independent display, not just mirroring
- Can show different screen than main plotter
- Often free app downloads from manufacturer
- May have limited functionality vs main unit
- Same connectivity and alarm limitations

### AIS Data on Mobile

- **Chart plotter AIS:** Real-time, direct VHF reception, full alarms
- **Internet AIS:** Delayed, shared data, no direct alarms
- **Mobile repeater:** Only shows what main plotter sends
- **Key limitation:** Most mobile repeaters lack CPA/TCPA audio alarms

### Use Cases

I'll help you understand when to use mobile repeaters:
- Cockpit viewing when main unit below
- Backup display if main screen fails
- Different crew members viewing different data
- **Not suitable** as primary navigation device

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Expecting full plotter functionality on mobile
❌ Not charging device, battery dies
❌ Using in bright sun without shade
❌ Assuming AIS alarms work on mobile

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Connect mobile device as repeater
- Identify 3 advantages and 3 disadvantages
- Explain why AIS alarms may not work on mobile
- Demonstrate viewing different screens (if app supports)
- Evaluate mobile vs dedicated second plotter decision
