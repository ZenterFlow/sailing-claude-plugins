# SKILL: Life Jacket Inspection, Maintenance, and Usage (SKILL_102)

## Description
Perform systematic inspection and maintenance of life jackets while enforcing proper usage protocols to ensure maximum survivability in man overboard situations for all crew members including children.

## Prerequisites
- Pre-Departure Safety Briefing and Equipment Verification (SKILL_098)

## Learning Objectives
- Conduct thorough life jacket inspection identifying wear and component failure
- Fit life jackets correctly with crotch strap and harness integration
- Enforce RYA usage policy based on risk conditions
- Select appropriate life jacket type for child crew members

**Pre-Use Inspection Procedure:**

**Bladder and Fabric Check:**
1. **Exterior Examination:** Look for abrasion, tears, or UV damage on outer cover
2. **Crevice Inspection:** Pay special attention to folding creases where bladder wears most
3. **Seam Integrity:** Check all stitched seams for unraveling or separation
4. **Reflective Tape:** Ensure SOLAS-grade tape is present and adhesive intact

**Inflation System Verification:**
1. **Gas Bottle Inspection:**
   - Remove bottle and check for rust or corrosion
   - Verify bottle is correct size/capacity for jacket model
   - Weigh bottle to confirm it hasn't partially discharged
   - Check bottle threads for damage
2. **Automatic Firing Unit:** 
   - Confirm unit hasn't been triggered (indicator not showing red)
   - Test dissolvable tablet if hydrostatic type
   - Check firing mechanism is free of corrosion
3. **Manual Inflation:** Test pull cord operation

**Accessory Functionality Check:**
1. **Whistle:** Blow to confirm sound
2. **Oral Inflation Tube:** Check valve opens and holds air
3. **Light Operation:** Activate water sensor or test battery (if fitted)
4. **Spray Hood:** Deploy and check visibility panels are clear
5. **Harness Integration:** Verify strong attachment points and D-rings

**Crotch Strap Configuration:**
- Adjust so jacket cannot ride up over head when in water
- Should be snug but not restrictive for movement
- Mandatory on all jackets for offshore use

**RYA Usage Policy Enforcement:**

**Mandatory Wear Situations:**
- **All non-swimmers:** Without exception, at all times
- **Night operations:** Always, with harness attached
- **Fog/restricted visibility:** Always when on deck
- **Reefing:** Before putting in second reef on sailing vessels
- **Dinghy operations:** Always when transferring to/from shore
- **High risk collision situations:** Until cleared from danger
- **Skipper discretion:** Whenever skipper requests
- **Personal choice:** Whenever crew member feels it necessary

**Harness Attachment Protocol:**
- Use integral harness with harness line to jackstays
- Jackstays: Canvas straps running along each side deck
- Clip on BEFORE leaving cockpit for foredeck work
- Mandatory when working at mast or on foredeck at night/strong conditions/fog
- **NEVER clip to guard rails** - not designed for load and won't prevent MOB

**Child-Specific Requirements:**
- **Correct Sizing:** Child must be fitted with age/weight-appropriate jacket
- **Oversize Danger:** Using oversized jacket can cause child to slip through and drown
- **Crotch Strap Critical:** Essential to prevent jacket riding up over small shoulders
- **Regular Refitting:** Check fit every trip as child grows

**Jacket Type Selection:**

**Features to Prioritize:**
- **Integral Harness:** Combined life jacket/harness unit ensures both are worn together
- **Spray Hood:** Protects airway from spray/waves, prevents drowning in unconscious casualty
- **Crotch Strap:** Prevents ride-up in water
- **Retro-Reflective Tape:** High visibility for SAR aircraft
- **Light:** Automatic water-activated LED strobe

**Maintenance Schedule:**
- **Pre-Trip:** Full inspection as detailed above
- **Monthly:** Light test, visual wear check
- **Annually:** Professional service for inflatable models
- **Post-Use:** If inflated, repack according to manufacturer instructions

**Storage Requirements:**
- Hang in dry, well-ventilated area (don't compress)
- Keep away from fuel or oil contamination
- Protect from UV when not in use
- Store with all accessories attached (light, whistle, hood)

## Common Errors
- Failing to check gas bottle for rust and correct sizing
- Omitting crotch strap adjustment allowing jacket ride-up
- Permitting non-swimmers to be without life jacket
- Clipping harness to guard rails instead of jackstays
- Using oversized life jacket for children
- Not testing light operation before departure
- Storing jackets in damp locker causing bladder deterioration

## Assessment
- Complete full life jacket inspection and identify three potential failure points
- Fit jacket on adult with proper crotch strap adjustment and harness integration
- State six conditions requiring mandatory life jacket wear per RYA policy
- Explain why guard rails are unsuitable for harness attachment
- Select appropriate jacket size for child based on weight/age chart
- Demonstrate manual inflation and oral inflation tube operation
- Show proper jackstay clip-on procedure for foredeck work
