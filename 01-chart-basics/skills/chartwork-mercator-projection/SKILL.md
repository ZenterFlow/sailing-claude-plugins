### Using Mercator projection

#### Electronic charts
A vector ENC does not have a projection. It is a database of images and locations which are populated against a model of the world (WGS 84) which are scalable.

Paper and raster charts

Paper charts will specify the type of projection used when the chart was constructed.
Raster charts will have the same projection as the paper chart they were based on.

Mercator projectionMercator Projection
Because of the way the charts are made the greater the latitude the larger the scale becomes.

The meridians and parallels of latitude project to straight lines with the projected meridians and parallels intersecting at right angles. This forms a grid pattern to the chart.

The projection is unbounded heading north and south so any distortion increases as it moves towards the polar regions and the least distortion is in equatorial regions.

The adjacent diagram shows that The Latitude Scale elongates as the latitude increases. This applies to both northern and southern hemispheres.

Because The Latitude Scale is used to measure distance on the chart and it being essential that distance measured is accurate, measurements taken at the edge of the chart must be at the same latitude as the chart work being measured.


mercator
For example, if working on an area of the chart with the approximate latitude 36°(N) the navigator should use The Latitude Scale in the area 36°(N) on the edge of the chart for measurement.

The Latitude Scale must not be confused with meridians of longitude which must never be used for measuring distance.

Land masses appear enlarged as you go north or south of the Equator so much so that Greenland can look almost the same size as Africa when in fact the land area is only 1/13 the size of Africa.

The image on the left shows how The Latitude Scale increase as you travel north or south of the Equator. Taken to its extreme, The Latitude Scale would be infinite at the poles and useless for navigation.

This is why it cannot be stressed enough that navigators should only measure distance on The Latitude Scale that is at the same latitude as the area they are trying to use the measurements for.

Transverse Mercator Projection

transverseThe transverse Mercator map projection is an adaptation of the standard Mercator projection.
It is widely used in national and international mapping systems around the world.

When paired with a suitable geodetic datum, the transverse Mercator delivers high accuracy in zones less than a few degrees in east-west extent.

Both projections are cylindrical: for the Normal Mercator, the axis of the cylinder coincides with the polar axis and the line of tangency with the Equator.

For the transverse Mercator, the axis of the cylinder lies in the equatorial plane, and the line of tangency is any chosen meridian, thereby designated the "central meridian".

Since the central meridian of the transverse Mercator can be chosen at will, it may be used to construct highly accurate maps (of narrow width) anywhere on the globe.

The adjacent Image shows the global view of a transverse Mercator projection map.

To produce a transverse Mercator projection chart, the chart maker will chose a meridian that passes near or through the centre of the chart being produced.
This method creates a very accurate chart in the area of the meridian which is ideal for charts covering small areas,

As you move away from the meridian the chart remains reasonably accurate up to around 15 degrees either side.

Charts covering small areas, transverse Mercator projection is very accurate and is excellent for river estuaries, port entry and pilotage.

Always make sure you have the right charts for the job in hand and they are up to date.
