## Purpose

Identify and interpret port hand and starboard hand lateral marks including color schemes, shapes, light characteristics, and passage rules for both IALA regions.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you ask about:
- Lateral marks or channel marks
- Port hand vs starboard hand marks
- Can vs cone shapes
- Preferred channel marks
- Regional color differences

## Behavior

### Port Hand Mark (Left Side of Channel)

**Purpose**: Marks left side when proceeding in direction of buoyage

**Shape**: Can (cylindrical - flat top)

**Colors by Region**:
- IALA A (Europe, etc.): RED body
- IALA B (Americas, etc.): GREEN body

**Topmark**: Single can (if fitted)

**Light**:
- IALA A: Red light
- IALA B: Green light
- Sequence: Any rhythm except 2+1

**Rule**: Leave to PORT (pass on your left)

### Starboard Hand Mark (Right Side of Channel)

**Purpose**: Marks right side when proceeding in direction of buoyage

**Shape**: Cone (pointed top)

**Colors by Region**:
- IALA A (Europe, etc.): GREEN body
- IALA B (Americas, etc.): RED body

**Topmark**: Single cone (if fitted)

**Light**:
- IALA A: Green light
- IALA B: Red light
- Sequence: Any rhythm except 2+1

**Rule**: Leave to STARBOARD (pass on your right)

### Memory Aid

**Shape**: "Can of beans sits flat" = Cylindrical port mark
**Shape**: "Ice cream cone is pointy" = Conical starboard mark

### Preferred Channel Marks

**Preferred Channel to PORT** (IALA A):
- Main channel: Treat as starboard mark
- Colors: Green body with red horizontal band
- Light: Fl(2+1)G - distinctive 2+1 rhythm
- Meaning: Main channel to starboard, secondary to port

**Preferred Channel to STARBOARD** (IALA A):
- Main channel: Treat as port mark  
- Colors: Red body with green horizontal band
- Light: Fl(2+1)R - distinctive 2+1 rhythm
- Meaning: Main channel to port, secondary to starboard

**Key**: 2+1 light rhythm = preferred channel indicator

### IALA B Regional Reversal

All colors invert:
- Port marks: GREEN (not red)
- Starboard marks: RED (not green)
- Shapes remain the same (can/cone)
- Light rhythms identical

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Confusing can (flat) and cone (pointy) shapes
❌ Forgetting which IALA region you're in
❌ Ignoring 2+1 light rhythm significance
❌ Passing wrong side due to color confusion
❌ Not checking direction of buoyage

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Identify mark type from color and shape
- Determine correct passage side
- Interpret 2+1 light sequence
- Apply correct regional colors
- Navigate safely through channels
