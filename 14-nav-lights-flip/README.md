- Sailing vessels and motor-sailing
- Fishing vessels (trawling vs other fishing)
- Special status vessels (NUC, RAM, CBD)
- Pilot vessels, towing, and pushing configurations
- Vessels at anchor and aground

**Key Exam Points**:
- Motor-sailing = forward masthead light mandatory
- NUC (two red vertical) vs RAM (red-white-red vertical)
- CBD (three red vertical) uses power-driven fog signals

**Coverage**:
- Ball (anchor), two balls (NUC), ball-diamond-ball (RAM)
- Cone apex down (motor-sailing)
- Cylinder (CBD)
- Two cones apexes together (trawling) vs apart (other fishing)
- Diamond (towing)
- Three balls vertical (aground)
- Special cases (minesweeping, diving operations)

**Critical Details**:
- All shapes must be black, minimum 0.6m diameter
- Cone apex DOWN for motor-sailing (not up)
- Three balls = aground, one ball = anchor

### 3. **sound-signal-quiz**
Quiz on fog signals, maneuvering signals, warning signals, and anchor signals.

**Coverage**:
- Fog signals (every 2 minutes): power making way, stopped, sailing/NUC/RAM
- Anchor signals (every 1 minute): bell, gong for >100m, aground pattern
- Maneuvering signals: course alteration (1/2/3 short blasts)
- Overtaking signals in narrow channels
- Danger/doubt signal (5+ short rapid blasts)

**Critical Intervals**:

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Lights Quiz Example
```
User: "Quiz me on navigation lights"

Agent: 🎯 QUESTION 1/10 - Navigation Lights

You observe a vessel showing:
- Green over white vertical lights
- Red and green sidelights
- White sternlight

What is this vessel doing?

A) Fishing with longlines
B) Trawling
C) Not under command
D) Dredging operations

[Awaiting answer: A, B, C, or D]

User: "B"

Agent: ✅ CORRECT!

B) Trawling

Explanation: Green over white vertical lights indicate a vessel engaged in
trawling (Rule 26). Red over white would be fishing with other methods.

Memory Aid: "Green over White, Trawling at Night"

[Score: 1/1 - 100%] 🔥 Perfect start!
```

### Day Shapes Quiz Example
```
User: "What shape does a motor-sailing vessel show?"

Agent: Great question! A sailing vessel under power (motor-sailing) must
display a BLACK CONE with the apex pointing DOWN, forward where it can
best be seen (Rule 25).

Critical Points:
- Apex must point DOWN (not up)
- Required whenever engine is running, even if still under sail
- Minimum 0.6m diameter
- Must be black

At night, motor-sailing vessel also shows forward masthead light +
sidelights + sternlight (same as power-driven vessel).

Memory Aid: "Apex Down, Engine's On"

```

### Sound Signals Quiz Example
```
User: "Sound signals quiz"

Agent: 🎯 QUESTION 1/10 - Sound Signals

You are a power-driven vessel making way in fog. What signal do you
sound and at what interval?

A) One prolonged blast every 1 minute
B) One prolonged blast every 2 minutes
C) Two prolonged blasts every 2 minutes
D) One prolonged + two short blasts every 2 minutes

User: "B"

Agent: ✅ CORRECT!

B) One prolonged blast every 2 minutes

Explanation: Power-driven vessel making way sounds ONE prolonged blast
(4-6 seconds) at intervals of not more than 2 minutes (Rule 35a).

Key Distinctions:
- Making way = 1 prolonged
- Stopped (not making way) = 2 prolonged
- Sailing/NUC/RAM = 1 prolonged + 2 short

Memory Aid: "One Long Alone, Power's Tone"

## 🔑 Critical Exam Distinctions

### Most Commonly Confused
1. **Motor-Sailing**: Must show masthead light + cone apex down
2. **NUC vs RAM**: Two red (NUC) vs red-white-red (RAM)
3. **CBD vs RAM**: Three red (CBD) + uses power signals, NOT RAM pattern
4. **Trawling vs Other Fishing**: Green-over-white (trawling) vs red-over-white (other)
5. **Anchor Intervals**: Every 1 minute (NOT 2 minutes)
6. **Aground vs Anchor**: Three balls (aground) vs one ball (anchor)
7. **Power Stopped vs Making Way**: Two prolonged (stopped) vs one prolonged (making way)

### Memory Aids Taught
- "Green over White, Trawling at Night"
- "White over Red, Pilot Ahead"
- "Three Reds High, Deep Draft Nigh"
- "Apex Down, Engine's On"
- "One Long Alone, Power's Tone"
- "Anchor Rings Every Single Minute"

## 🚢 Real-World Application

**Night Watch Scenarios:**
"When you're on night watch in busy shipping lanes, you have seconds to identify that vessel showing two red vertical lights as Not Under Command and take appropriate action. This isn't just exam knowledge—it's life-safety knowledge. Our quizzes drill you until recognition is instant and automatic."

**Fog Navigation:**
"Hearing sound signals in fog requires instant pattern recognition. One prolonged blast? Power-driven making way. One prolonged + two short? Could be sailing, NUC, RAM, or fishing. Our sound signal quiz trains your ear to distinguish these critical patterns."

**Daylight Vessel Identification:**
"That vessel showing a cylinder shape? Constrained by draft—stay clear and understand they have limited maneuvering ability. Black cone apex down? Motor-sailing—treat as power-driven vessel. Instant shape recognition keeps you safe and legal."
