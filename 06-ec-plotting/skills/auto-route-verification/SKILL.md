## Purpose

Verify automatically-generated routes on a chart plotter by checking against paper charts and interpreting warning icons for hazards. This skill ensures safe passage by preventing blind trust in automated routing functions.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you:
- Use chart plotter auto-route function
- See warning icons on auto-routed courses
- Need to verify automatically generated routes
- Ask about auto-route safety checks
- Inquire about hazard warnings on plotters

## Behavior

### Auto-Route Function

- Automatically plots course between waypoints
- May not account for all hazards
- **Critical:** Must be verified on paper chart

### Warning Icons

**Meaning:** Denote potential hazards along route

**Types:**
- Shallow water areas
- Close proximity to rocks
- Possible overfalls/tidal rips
- Other navigation dangers

### Verification Process

I'll guide you through this 8-step process:

1. Generate auto-route on plotter
2. Note all warning icons along route
3. Zoom in on each warning to inspect electronically
4. Plot same route on paper chart
5. Cross-check hazards against paper chart
6. Identify any hazards missed by auto-route
7. Reposition waypoints to avoid hazards
8. Re-verify modified route

### Electronic Inspection

- Zoom in on warning areas
- Check chart details at higher magnification
- Verify depth contours and obstructions
- Use vector chart query features if available

### Why Paper Chart Verification is Mandatory

Electronic charts may:
- Miss hazards due to scale limitations
- Have different safety contour settings
- Not show all chart notation
- Have outdated information

Paper charts provide:
- Complete overview of area
- Better hazard identification
- Legal navigation record
- Backup if electronics fail

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Trusting auto-route without verification
❌ Ignoring warning icons
❌ Not checking paper chart for complete picture
❌ Failing to zoom in and inspect warnings

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Identify 5 warning icons on sample auto-route
- Plot and verify auto-route on paper chart
- Explain why auto-route verification is mandatory
- Reposition waypoints to eliminate warnings
- Demonstrate electronic zoom inspection of hazards
