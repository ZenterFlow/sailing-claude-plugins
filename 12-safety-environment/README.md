- Diversion decision factors (safe anchorage, traffic density, duration, crew fatigue)

**radar-reflector-integration** - Install, maintain, and integrate radar reflectors and AIS systems to maximize vessel detection.

**Topics:**
- Reflector type selection (fixed octahedral, collapsible, active powered)
- Installation optimization (minimum 4m height, clear line of sight, free rotation)
- Material-specific requirements (GRP/wood/carbon MUST have reflector)
- AIS integration for collision avoidance (CPA/TCPA, vessel identification)
- ARPA/MARPA capabilities (automatic target tracking, trial maneuver)

## Teaching Approach

### Safety-Critical Mindset
- **Lives Depend on Procedures:** No shortcuts, no exceptions
- **Drill-Based Learning:** Repetition creates automatic responses in emergencies
- **Pre-Departure Discipline:** Complete equipment verification every time
- **Shore Contact Mandatory:** Always establish "latest arrival" time

### Progressive Learning Path
1. **Foundation:** Pre-departure briefing and equipment verification
2. **Systems:** LPG and fire safety management
3. **Equipment:** Life jackets, dinghy operations, drogues
4. **Communications:** EPIRB/PLB, Mayday calls, distress signals
5. **Advanced:** Fog navigation, radar/AIS integration

## Critical Safety Rules

### Engine Compartment Fire
**NEVER OPEN ENGINE BAY** - Introducing oxygen causes catastrophic flashback
1. Shut engine down
2. Activate automatic extinguisher or use access hole
3. Prepare to abandon ship

### Gas Leak Response
**NO ELECTRICAL SWITCHES** - Sparking can ignite gas
1. Ventilate (open all hatches)
2. Manual bilge pump only
3. Secure gas supply (bottle and galley valve)
4. Evacuate if necessary

### Life Jacket Requirements
**Crotch Strap is Essential** - Without it, jacket rides up and person slips out
- Mandatory: Non-swimmers, night ops, fog, reefing, dinghy use
- Harness: Clip to jackstays NEVER to guard rails
- Children: Correct sizing critical (oversize = drowning risk)

### Mayday Call Format
```
MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY
This is [vessel name] [vessel name] [vessel name]
Callsign [ABC123] MMSI [235123456]
MAYDAY [vessel name]
My position [bearing & distance from known point]
[Nature of distress]
Require immediate assistance
[Number] persons on board
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Pre-Departure Safety Brief
```
User: "I'm about to depart on a 24-hour passage. What should I cover in the safety brief?"

Safety Tutor (using pre-departure-safety-briefing):
**Pre-Departure Safety Brief Checklist:**

**1. Equipment Verification (Do This First):**
- Life Jackets: Check gas bottles, crotch straps, lights, whistles
- Flares: 4 red rocket, 4 red hand-held, 2 orange smoke, 2 white warning
- Fire Extinguishers: Annual service tags, pressure gauges, powder movement
- Gas System: Test shut-off valves, verify external-draining locker

**2. Safety Brief to Crew:**
- Life Jacket Policy: Mandatory at night, in fog, during reefing, in dinghy
- Harness Attachment: Clip to jackstays ONLY, NEVER to guard rails
- VHF Mayday: DSC button sequence + Channel 16 voice call
- EPIRB Location: [show location], remove from bracket, deploy antenna, switch ON
- Fire Protocol: Engine fire = NEVER open bay, galley fire = blanket first
- MOB Equipment: [show locations], life ring has drogue attached
- Gas Shut-Off: Galley valve + bottle valve locations

**3. Shore Contact Setup:**
- Register passage plan with coastguard (RYA SafeTrx app)
- Provide: Route, ETA, "LATEST ARRIVAL" time (critical!)
- Proposed refuge ports en route
- Crew count, safety equipment inventory
- Contact: [shore contact name] has instructions to raise alarm if not checked in

**4. Vessel Operations:**
- Engine: Start procedure, spare parts location
- Heads: [explain what can/cannot be flushed]
- Galley: Cooker operation, gas shut-off, fire blanket location
- Radar Reflector: [show if collapsible, explain deployment]

**Don't Depart Until:**
✓ All equipment inspected and serviceable
✓ All crew briefed and understand emergency procedures
✓ Shore contact established with "latest arrival" time
✓ Fuel 7/8 full, sufficient water/provisions
```

### Example 2: Engine Compartment Fire
```
User: "Smoke is coming from the engine compartment! What do I do?"

Safety Tutor (using fire-safety-management):
**ENGINE COMPARTMENT FIRE - CRITICAL PROTOCOL:**

**DO NOT OPEN ENGINE BAY!**
Opening it introduces oxygen causing catastrophic flashback that intensifies fire.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. **Shut Engine Down:** Stop immediately, cut fuel supply
2. **Alert Crew:** Sound alarm, assign roles, don life jackets
3. **Activate Automatic Extinguisher:** If fitted, allow it to discharge
4. **Manual Discharge via Access Hole:**
   - Locate access hole (should be marked on engine bay)
   - Discharge dry powder extinguisher through hole
   - DO NOT open main bay door
5. **Ventilate After:** Wait 5 minutes, then cautiously ventilate
6. **Prepare to Abandon:**
   - If fire uncontrollable, prepare life raft for launch
   - Activate EPIRB if abandoning vessel
   - Transmit Mayday: "MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY... fire in engine compartment"

**Why NEVER Open Bay:**
Fire needs oxygen. Enclosed engine bay has limited oxygen, so fire may be smoldering. Opening bay creates massive oxygen rush = flashback explosion intensifying fire dramatically.

**After Fire Out:**
- Do NOT restart engine until cause identified and repaired
- Check for fuel leaks, electrical shorts, hot exhaust issues
- Document in logbook with time, actions taken, crew involved
```

### Example 3: Fog Encounter
```
User: "Visibility just dropped to about 50 meters. What should I do immediately?"

Safety Tutor (using fog-navigation):
**FOG ENCOUNTER - IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (First 2 Minutes):**

**1. Establish Position:**
- Fix position on chart using GPS lat/long
- Note exact time
- Record in logbook

**2. Don Life Jackets:**
- ALL crew put on life jackets immediately
- Adjust crotch straps
- Attach harnesses if going on deck

**3. Deploy Radar Reflector:**
- If collapsible type, deploy now to masthead
- Ensure free to rotate
- If fixed type, verify it's in position

**4. Navigation Lights:**
- Turn ON: Steaming light, bow lights, stern light
- Check all are functioning

**5. Reduce Speed:**
- Visibility 50m = must be able to stop within 25m
- SAFE SPEED RULE: Stop within HALF visible distance
- For most vessels: Reduce to bare steerageway (2-3 knots)

**6. Sound Fog Signal:**
- Sailing vessel: 1 prolonged + 2 short blasts every 2 minutes
- If motoring: 1 prolonged blast every 2 minutes

**NEXT STEPS (Minutes 3-5):**
7. **Extra Lookouts:** Post crew to watch for lights/sounds
8. **Engine Ready:** Start engine for maneuverability (even if sailing)
9. **Wake Crew:** Wake anyone in fore cabin (collision risk highest forward)
10. **White Flare Ready:** Keep handheld white flare for close-quarters warning
11. **Radar ON:** If fitted, use 3-mile range, tune for small targets
12. **VHF Monitor:** Channel 16 for traffic reports and other vessels

**DECISION POINT:**
- Safe anchorage nearby? Consider waiting out fog
- Heavy traffic area? May be safer to anchor than proceed
- Forecast clearing in 1-2 hours? Wait may be prudent
- Crew fatigued? Long fog transit is extremely tiring

**Why This Matters:**
- GRP/wooden vessels are invisible to radar without reflector deployed
- Safe speed in fog prevents collision when you can't see
- Life jackets mandatory because collision risk highest in fog
- Sound signals alert others to your presence when radar fails
