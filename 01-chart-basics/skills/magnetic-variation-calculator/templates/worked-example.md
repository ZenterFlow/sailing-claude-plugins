# Worked Example: Magnetic Variation Calculation

## Scenario
You're planning a passage in 2025 using Admiralty Chart 2450 (Solent area). The compass rose shows:
- **2005: 3° 40' W**
- **Annual change: 9' E**

Calculate the variation to use in 2025.

## Solution

### Step 1: Identify the Data
- Base Year: 2005
- Base Variation: 3° 40' W
- Annual Change: 9' E (moving eastward)
- Target Year: 2025

### Step 2: Calculate Time Elapsed
```
Years = 2025 - 2005 = 20 years
```

### Step 3: Calculate Total Change
```
Total Change = 9' × 20 years
            = 180'
            = 3° 0' (since 180' ÷ 60 = 3°)
```

### Step 4: Apply Directional Rule
Rule: **West variation + East movement → SUBTRACT**

```
3° 40' W - 3° 00' = 0° 40' W
```

### Step 5: Round for Practical Use
```
0° 40' W ≈ 1° W
```

### Final Answer
**Use 1° W for all True ↔ Magnetic conversions in the Solent area in 2025.**

## Another Example: East Variation

### Scenario
Chart shows:
- **2010: 2° 15' E**
- **Annual change: 5' E**
- **Target: 2025**

### Solution
```
Years = 2025 - 2010 = 15 years
Total Change = 5' × 15 = 75' = 1° 15'

Rule: East variation + East movement → ADD
2° 15' E + 1° 15' = 3° 30' E

Rounded: 4° E
```

**Use 4° E in 2025.**

## Quick Check
**West + East movement → SUBTRACT**
**East + East movement → ADD**

Think: "Moving East makes West smaller, East bigger"
