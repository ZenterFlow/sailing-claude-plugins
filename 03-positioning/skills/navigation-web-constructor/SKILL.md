## Purpose

Create a pre-plotted navigation web of bearings and distance arcs from a waypoint to enable rapid position monitoring and tacking decisions. This technique is invaluable for racing, night navigation, and fog where you need instant position awareness from GPS bearing and distance readings.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you:
- Ask about navigation webs or pre-plotted grids
- Need rapid position monitoring near a waypoint
- Want to make quick tacking decisions
- Inquire about bearing/distance grid construction
- Need navigation aids for night or fog approaches

## Behavior

### What is a Navigation Web?

A navigation web is a pre-plotted grid radiating from a destination waypoint, showing:
- **Bearing lines** at 5° or 10° intervals from the waypoint
- **Distance arcs** at 0.5 or 1.0 mile intervals
- Instant visual position from GPS bearing/distance readings
- No plotting needed - just read GPS and look at chart

### Construction Method

**1. Setup:**
- Identify destination waypoint (harbor entrance, mark, etc.)
- Draw ground track line to waypoint (to nearest 5°)
- Mark waypoint center clearly

**2. Draw Bearing Lines:**
- Draw lines radiating from waypoint at 5° or 10° intervals
- Extend lines beyond expected approach area (typically 5-10nm)
- Label each line with bearing (True) from waypoint
- Cover anticipated approach sector (e.g., 80°-320° for westerly approach)

**3. Draw Distance Arcs:**
- Using compass, draw circles at 1 mile intervals from waypoint
- Alternative: 0.5 mile intervals for close approach (<5nm)
- Label each arc with distance (1M, 2M, 3M, 4M, 5M, etc.)
- Extend far enough to cover entire approach

**4. Label Clearly:**
- Bearing lines in bold (True bearings)
- Distance arcs in different color if possible
- Keep labels readable at night with red light

### Using the Navigation Web

**Instant Position:**
- GPS shows: "Bearing 050°, Distance 4.0M to WPT"
- Look at chart: intersection of 050° line and 4M arc = your position
- No plotting, no delay, instant awareness

**Tacking Decisions:**
- **Example**: Northerly destination, westerly wind
- On port tack: tack before bearing <320°(T) to avoid land
- On starboard tack: tack before bearing >050°(T) to stay in channel
- Helmsman can make instant decisions from GPS readout

**Time Monitoring:**
- Every 15 minutes: note GPS bearing/distance
- Track progress visually on pre-plotted grid
- Identify if tidal stream is stronger/weaker than expected

### Practical Applications

**Racing:**
- Optimize tacking angles to laylines
- Instant awareness of position relative to mark
- Quick decisions in pressure

**Night Navigation:**
- No need for chart table plotting in darkness
- Helmsman has instant position awareness
- Safety monitoring for hazards

**Fog Navigation:**
- Rapid position checks without visual references
- Combined with radar overlay for complete picture
- Critical safety tool

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Uneven spacing of bearings or arcs
❌ Not covering full approach sector
❌ Forgetting to label lines clearly
❌ Using magnetic instead of True bearings
❌ Too many lines making chart cluttered

### Best Practices

✅ Use 10° intervals for offshore, 5° for close approach
✅ Draw in pencil first, then ink when satisfied
✅ Keep labels outside main navigation area
✅ Test readability in red light if using at night
✅ Update if waypoint changes

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Construct complete web for harbor entry in <15 minutes
- Plot 5 positions from GPS readings using web in <30 seconds each
- Demonstrate tacking decision using web
- Explain time savings vs continuous plotting
- Identify when web is most useful vs traditional plotting
