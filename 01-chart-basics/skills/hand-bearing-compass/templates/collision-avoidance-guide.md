# Collision Avoidance Using Steady Bearing

## The Fundamental Principle

**IF BEARING REMAINS CONSTANT → COLLISION RISK EXISTS**

This is geometry, not guesswork:
- Two vessels on collision course maintain constant relative bearing
- Bearing changes mean vessels will pass clear of each other
- Amount of change indicates passing distance

## The Procedure

### Step 1: Initial Detection
```
CONTACT SPOTTED

1. Identify vessel visually
   - Direction relative to own vessel
   - Type/size if visible
   - Approximate range

2. Take first bearing
   - Use hand bearing compass
   - Stand away from metal
   - Record precise bearing
   - Note exact time

Example:
Time: 1430 UTC
Bearing: 315°(M)
Contact: White motorboat, ~2 NM
```

### Step 2: Monitor Over Time
```
WAIT 3-5 MINUTES

For close contacts: 3 minutes
For distant contacts: 5 minutes
For fast contacts: 2 minutes

DO DURING WAIT:
- Maintain steady course and speed
  (Changing course invalidates bearing comparison)
- Keep visual watch on contact
- Prepare for evasive action if needed
- Check COLREGS right-of-way obligations
```

### Step 3: Second Bearing
```
SECOND MEASUREMENT

1. Take new bearing of same vessel
   - Same technique as first bearing
   - Stand in same location if possible
   - Record precise bearing and time

Example:
Time: 1434 UTC (4 minutes later)
Bearing: 315°(M)
Contact: Same vessel, now ~1.5 NM
```

### Step 4: Interpret Results

#### Scenario A: BEARING STEADY (±2-3°)
```
Initial:  315°(M) at 1430
Second:   315°(M) at 1434
Change:   0° → STEADY

INTERPRETATION:
⚠️ COLLISION RISK EXISTS

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Determine right-of-way (COLREGS)
2. If give-way vessel:
   - Make EARLY, SUBSTANTIAL course alteration
   - Alteration must be OBVIOUS to other vessel
   - Turn at least 30-45° (not just 5-10°)
   - OR reduce speed significantly
3. If stand-on vessel:
   - Maintain course and speed initially
   - Monitor if other vessel takes action
   - Be prepared to maneuver if needed
4. Continue monitoring bearing
5. Don't resume course until clear
```

#### Scenario B: BEARING DRAWING AFT (Increasing)
```
Initial:  315°(M) at 1430
Second:   320°(M) at 1434
Change:   +5° → DRAWING AFT

INTERPRETATION:
✓ Vessel passing ASTERN (behind you)

SAFETY LEVEL:
- Low immediate risk
- Will pass clear astern
- Rate of change indicates passing distance

ACTION:
- Continue monitoring
- No immediate maneuver needed
- Maintain steady course
- Recheck if bearing stops changing
```

#### Scenario C: BEARING DRAWING FORWARD (Decreasing)
```
Initial:  315°(M) at 1430
Second:   310°(M) at 1434
Change:   -5° → DRAWING FORWARD

INTERPRETATION:
✓ Vessel passing AHEAD (in front of you)

SAFETY LEVEL:
- Low immediate risk
- Will pass clear ahead
- Rate of change indicates passing distance

ACTION:
- Continue monitoring
- No immediate maneuver needed
- Watch for slow bearing change (may still be close pass)
- Consider small speed reduction if concerned
```

## Rate of Change Interpretation

### Fast Change (5-10° in 5 minutes)
- Wide passing distance
- Low risk
- Monitor only

### Slow Change (1-2° in 5 minutes)
- Close passing distance
- Moderate risk
- Consider precautionary maneuver
- Continue close monitoring

### No Change (0° in 5 minutes)
- Collision course
- High risk
- Immediate action required

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Clear Collision Risk
```
1420: Vessel spotted, bearing 045°(M), ~3 NM
1425: Bearing 045°(M), ~2 NM
1430: Bearing 045°(M), ~1 NM

ANALYSIS: Bearing steady for 10 minutes
          Range decreasing rapidly
          COLLISION RISK CONFIRMED

ACTION:  You are overtaking (approaching from astern)
         You are give-way vessel
         Alter course to starboard 45°
         New bearing should draw aft
         Maintain alteration until clear
```

### Example 2: Safe Passing
```
1400: Vessel spotted, bearing 280°(M), ~4 NM
1405: Bearing 283°(M), ~3.5 NM
1410: Bearing 287°(M), ~3 NM

ANALYSIS: Bearing drawing aft (+7° in 10 min)
          Vessel passing behind
          Safe passage

ACTION:  Monitor but no maneuver needed
         Will pass astern by safe distance
```

### Example 3: Close But Clear
```
1415: Vessel spotted, bearing 120°(M), ~2 NM
1420: Bearing 118°(M), ~1.5 NM
1425: Bearing 115°(M), ~1 NM

ANALYSIS: Bearing drawing forward (-5° in 10 min)
          Vessel passing ahead
          May be close pass

ACTION:  No immediate danger
         Consider slight speed reduction
         Maintain sharp lookout
         Prepare to maneuver if bearing steadies
```

## Integration with COLREGS

**Power-Driven Vessels Meeting:**
- Head-on: Both alter to starboard
- Crossing: Vessel with other on starboard gives way
- Overtaking: Overtaking vessel gives way

**Sail vs Power:**
- Generally power gives way to sail
- EXCEPT: Sail overtaking power

**Special Circumstances:**
- Restricted visibility: All vessels proceed at safe speed
- Narrow channels: Stay to starboard
- Traffic separation schemes: Follow traffic flow

**Key Point:**
Knowing right-of-way is essential, but:
- Always act to avoid collision regardless of right-of-way
- Make intentions obvious
- Act early and substantially

## Equipment Tips

### Hand Bearing Compass Technique
- Stand in same spot for related bearings
- Hold steady and level
- Let card settle fully
- Read to nearest degree
- Record immediately (don't trust memory)

### Night/Low Visibility
- Bearing techniques work in any visibility
- Sight on vessel's lights
- Steady bearing still means collision risk
- Earlier action required (less visual info)
- Consider radar if fitted

## Quick Reference Card

```
COLLISION AVOIDANCE CHECKLIST
──────────────────────────────────
1. DETECT: Sight vessel, take bearing & time
2. WAIT: 3-5 min, maintain course/speed
3. MEASURE: Take second bearing & time
4. COMPARE:
   • Steady (±2°) → COLLISION RISK → ACT
   • Drawing aft (+) → Passing astern → Monitor
   • Drawing fwd (-) → Passing ahead → Monitor
5. ACT IF NEEDED:
   • Check COLREGS right-of-way
   • Maneuver early and substantially
   • Make intentions obvious
   • Continue monitoring until clear

REMEMBER:
"Steady bearing = collision risk"
Act early, act obviously, don't guess!
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Single bearing only | Can't detect trend | Always take multiple |
| Changing own course | Invalidates comparison | Maintain steady C/S |
| Small alterations | Other vessel may not see | Alter at least 30° |
| Late action | Close quarters situation | Act when risk identified |
| Assuming other sees you | Collision occurs | Don't assume, take action |
| Forgetting COLREGS | Wrong vessel maneuvers | Review right-of-way rules |

## When This Technique Fails

**NOT RELIABLE:**
- Very close range (<0.5 NM): visual judgment better
- Multiple vessels: too many to track systematically
- High-speed craft: bearing changes too fast
- You're maneuvering: bearing changes don't indicate clear

**BETTER METHODS IN THESE CASES:**
- Radar with ARPA
- Visual assessment of aspect/range
- VHF communication
- Multiple observers
