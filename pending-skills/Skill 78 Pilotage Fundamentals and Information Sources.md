# SKILL: Pilotage Fundamentals and Information Sources (SKILL_78)

## Description
Master the core concept of pilotage using visible references to avoid invisible hazards, and identify critical information sources for safe harbor navigation.

## Prerequisites
- Basic chart reading
- Visual Aids to Navigation (SKILL_69-77)

## Learning Objectives
- Define pilotage and its purpose
- Identify key information sources in almanacs and pilot books
- Explain why GNSS alone is insufficient for close-quarters navigation
- Describe proper cockpit navigation practices
- Apply variation to bearing conversions

**Core Concept**
Pilotage is using visible objects to avoid invisible dangers. The fundamental principle is maintaining situational awareness through direct observation rather than relying solely on electronic systems.

**Essential Information Sources**
**Almanac Contents:**
- Entry waypoints and harbor approaches
- Local hazards and obstruction details
- Visual depth information and sounding data
- Small boat channels and traffic lanes
- Charted transits and leading lines
- Mooring locations and types
- Port traffic regulations and VHF channels
- Local buoyage movements and patterns
- Detailed port and marina plans

**Chart Information:**
- Depth contours for safe corridors
- Charted transits (magenta lines with true bearings)
- Buoyage positions and characteristics
- Visual landmarks and prominent objects
- Tidal stream data

**Why Not Rely on Chartplotter Alone**
- **Position Fix vs Situational Awareness:** GNSS shows where you are but not what is around you
- **Visual Verification:** Depth gauge and visual features confirm position
- **Cockpit Presence:** Navigator must be on deck to monitor crew and surroundings
- **False Security:** Below-deck navigation creates dangerous detachment from real environment
- **Best Practice:** Use GNSS as one tool among many, not primary pilotage method

**Information Gathering**
- **Almanac Coverage:** Not all sailing areas have dedicated almanacs
- **Local Publications:** Use when almanac unavailable
- **Multiple Sources:** Combine charts, almanac, pilot books, cruising guides
- **Local Knowledge:** Supplement published information with harbor master advice

**Variation Application**
- **Charted Bearings:** Typically shown in TRUE
- **Hand Bearing Compass:** Reads MAGNETIC only
- **Conversion:** Always apply variation to use plotted bearings with hand compass
- **Example:** If variation is 6°W, magnetic bearing = true bearing - 6°

## Common Errors
- Attempting pilotage from below deck using only chartplotter
- Neglecting to consult almanac for port-specific regulations
- Forgetting to convert true bearings to magnetic for hand compass use
- Relying on inexperienced crew to monitor position while skipper is below
- Failing to research areas not covered by standard almanacs

## Assessment
- List minimum five information categories from almanac for harbor entry
- Explain why visual observation is superior to GNSS for close-quarters navigation
- Convert true bearing to magnetic given variation
- Identify information gaps for uncharted areas
- Evaluate proper navigation station location during pilotage
