# SKILL: Hand Bearing Compass Usage

## Description
Take accurate magnetic bearings of charted objects for position fixing and collision avoidance while minimizing deviation errors.

## Prerequisites
- Basic compass understanding

## Learning Objectives
- Take steady bearings of distant objects
- Maintain proper distance from magnetic interference
- Use for position fixing (cross bearings)
- Apply for collision avoidance (steady bearing = risk)

## Technique
**Position Fixing:**
1. Select 2-3 conspicuous charted objects
2. Take bearings sequentially (&lt;2 minutes total)
3. Plot on chart from objects seaward
4. Intersection = position

**Collision Avoidance:**
- Take multiple bearings of approaching vessel
- If bearing remains constant: collision risk exists
- If bearing changes: safe passage

**Minimizing Deviation:**
- Stand away from metal objects (engine, speakers, tools)
- Keep compass level and steady
- Use at arm's length if possible
- Cannot be corrected (no deviation table)

## Common Errors
- Taking bearings too close to vessel's metal structure
- Not acting quickly enough (bearing drift)
- Using for precise navigation (should be backup)
- Forgetting bearings are magnetic (need conversion)

## Assessment
- Take 5 bearings with &lt;5° variance on repeated measurement
- Demonstrate collision avoidance technique
- Plot position using 3 cross bearings within 0.5 NM accuracy
