## Purpose

Identify cloud types, interpret their significance for weather forecasting, and predict approaching conditions based on cloud sequences.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you ask about:
- Cloud types or identification
- Cumulus, stratus, cirrus clouds
- Cumulonimbus characteristics
- Cloud sequences and frontal systems
- Weather prediction from clouds

## Behavior

### Cloud Formation Basics

**Process**: Air lifts and cools until reaching dew point

**Condensation**: Water vapor becomes visible as clouds

**Significance**: Visual indication of vertical weather profile

### Cloud Shape Indicators

**Flat (Stratus) Clouds:**
- **Indication**: Stable atmospheric conditions
- **Wind**: Gradual changes
- **Vertical Movement**: Limited
- **Associated With**: Warm fronts, settled conditions

**Vertical/Puffy (Cumulus) Clouds:**
- **Indication**: Unstable atmospheric conditions
- **Wind**: Gusty, squally conditions
- **Vertical Movement**: Significant
- **Associated With**: Cold fronts, convection, turbulence

### Classification System

**Combination of shape + altitude = cloud type**

### Low Clouds (Surface to 2,000m / 6,500ft)

- **Stratus (St)**: Flat, layered, continuous sheet
- **Cumulus (Cu)**: Puffy, individual heaps, fair weather
- **Nimbostratus (Ns)**: Flat rain-bearing cloud (nimbus = rain)
- **Fractostratus**: Patchy, breaking up flat cloud (fracto = breaking)

### Medium Clouds (2,000-5,000m / 6,500-16,500ft)

- **Altostratus (As)**: Flat sheet at medium altitude
- **Altocumulus (Ac)**: Puffy heaps at medium altitude
- **Characteristics**: Opaque, sun appears as through frosted glass

### High Clouds (Above 5,000m / 16,500ft)

- **Cirrostratus (Cs)**: Thin veil, halo around sun/moon
- **Cirrocumulus (Cc)**: Small puffy ripples, "mackerel sky"
- **Cirrus (Ci)**: Wispy, feathery, first sign of approaching system

### Cumulonimbus (Cb) - Special Category

**Height**: Multi-level, towers up to 12km (38,000ft)

**Appearance**:
- Flat base often <100m above sea
- Dark wall-like feature underneath
- Towering vertical development

**Weather**: Classic thunderstorms

**Hazards**:
- Strong turbulence
- Heavy precipitation
- Lightning
- Squall lines with cold fronts

**Timing**: Develops after cold front passage

### Frontal Cloud Sequences (NH Low Pressure)

**Approaching Warm Front**:
1. **Cirrus (Ci)**: High wispy clouds (first sign, 12-24 hrs out)
2. **Cirrostratus (Cs)**: Thin veil, halo effect
3. **Altostratus (As)**: Opaque sheet, sun blurred
4. **Nimbostratus (Ns)**: Thick rain-bearing layer
5. **Precipitation**: Continuous rain begins
6. **Visibility**: Deteriorates to poor

**Warm Sector**:
- **Clouds**: Low stratus, possible fog
- **Conditions**: Drizzle, mist, poor visibility
- **Stability**: Relatively stable but moist

**Approaching Cold Front**:
- **Clouds**: Cumulus building vertically
- **Development**: Towering cumulonimbus
- **Conditions**: Squalls, thunderstorms

**Post-Cold Front**:
- **Clouds**: Scattered cumulus
- **Conditions**: Showers, good visibility between showers
- **Visibility**: Generally good except in showers

### Cloud Type Identification Guide

| Cloud Name | Height | Shape | Precipitation | Visibility Impact |
|------------|--------|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Cirrus | High | Wispy/feathery | None | Good |
| Cirrostratus | High | Thin veil | None | Good (halo) |
| Altostratus | Medium | Flat sheet | Possible light | Moderate to poor |
| Nimbostratus | Low-medium | Thick flat | Continuous rain | Poor |
| Stratus | Low | Flat layer | Drizzle | Poor |
| Cumulus | Low | Puffy heaps | None (fair weather) | Good |
| Cumulonimbus | Multi-level | Towering vertical | Heavy/showers | Very poor to good between |
| Fractostratus | Any | Patchy fragments | Variable | Variable |

### Cloud Height Memory Aid

- **Cirro-**: High (above 5,000m)
- **Alto-**: Medium (2,000-5,000m)
- **No prefix**: Low (surface-2,000m)

### Weather Prediction Using Clouds

**Stable Conditions (Stratus Dominant)**:
- Gradual wind changes
- Steady precipitation (if any)
- Poor but steady visibility
- Warm frontal approach/passage

**Unstable Conditions (Cumulus Dominant)**:
- Gusty, squally winds
- Showery precipitation
- Rapid visibility changes
- Cold frontal approach/passage
- Afternoon convection (sea breezes)

### Cumulonimbus Warning Signs

**Vertical Development**: Cloud towers rapidly

**Dark Base**: Very dark, wall-like appearance

**Approach Time**: 30 minutes to few hours

**Action**: Reef early, prepare for squalls before arrival

### Visibility Changes

**Approaching Frontal System**:
- Cirrus → Cirrostratus: No visibility change
- Altostratus → Nimbostratus: Visibility deteriorates to poor
- Continuous rain: Poor visibility persists

**Cold Front Passage**:
- Pre-frontal cumulonimbus: Very poor visibility
- Post-frontal showers: Good visibility between showers

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Confusing altostratus with cirrostratus altitude
❌ Missing cumulonimbus development until too late
❌ Not recognizing cirrus as first warning sign
❌ Forgetting nimbostratus indicates continuous rain
❌ Misidentifying fracto- clouds as new types
❌ Ignoring cloud shape indicators of stability

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Identify cloud type from description or image
- Predict weather sequence from observed clouds
- Determine atmospheric stability from cloud shapes
- Recognize cumulonimbus hazards and timing
- Forecast visibility changes from cloud progression
- Apply cloud height prefix system

### Practical Application

**Scenario**: Observe high cirrus clouds appearing

1. **Identification**: Cirrus (high, wispy)
2. **Significance**: First sign of approaching system
3. **Timeframe**: 12-24 hours to arrival
4. **Expectation**: Watch for cirrostratus, then altostratus
5. **Action**: Monitor barometer, prepare for frontal passage

**Scenario**: Dark towering cloud approaching rapidly

1. **Identification**: Cumulonimbus
2. **Hazards**: Squalls, heavy rain, lightning, turbulence
3. **Timing**: 30 minutes to few hours
4. **Action**: Reef now, prepare crew, secure deck
5. **After passage**: Expect clearing and showers
