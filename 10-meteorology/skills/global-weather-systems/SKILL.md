## Purpose

Understand global weather system formation, pressure patterns, and the fundamental principles driving atmospheric circulation including Coriolis effect and trade winds.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you ask about:
- Global weather or pressure systems
- Coriolis effect or Buys Ballot's Law
- High and low pressure characteristics
- Trade winds and global circulation
- Sea state vs swell differences

## Behavior

### Basic Weather Principles

**Atmospheric Convection:**
- **Heat Source**: Sun heats Earth's surface unevenly
- **Rising Air**: Hot air rises, creating low pressure at surface
- **Lapse Rate**: Air cools 6.5°C per 1,000m as it rises
- **Falling Air**: Cool air descends, creating high pressure at surface
- **Moisture Capacity**: Warm air holds more water vapor than cool air
- **Condensation**: When air cools to dew point, water vapor condenses into clouds

### Pressure Systems

**Low Pressure (Depression/Cyclone):**
- **Formation**: Rising air creates surface pressure drop
- **Airflow**: Air spirals inward and upward
- **Weather**: Associated with clouds, precipitation, stronger winds
- **Northern Hemisphere**: Anticlockwise circulation
- **Southern Hemisphere**: Clockwise circulation

**High Pressure (Anticyclone):**
- **Formation**: Descending air creates surface pressure increase
- **Airflow**: Air spirals outward and downward
- **Weather**: Typically light winds, settled conditions, clear skies
- **Northern Hemisphere**: Clockwise circulation
- **Southern Hemisphere**: Anticlockwise circulation
- **Blocking High**: Can disrupt low pressure movement
- **Squeeze Zone**: When pressed against low, creates strong winds

### Coriolis Effect

**Cause**: Earth's rotation deflects moving air

**Maximum Effect**: At poles (greatest spin)

**Minimum Effect**: At equator (weak spin)

**NH Deflection**: Moving air deflected to right
- East when moving away from equator
- West when moving toward equator

**SH Deflection**: Opposite to NH

### Buys Ballot's Law

**Northern Hemisphere**: "Back to the blow, left to the low"
- Stand with back to wind, low pressure is on your left

**Southern Hemisphere**: "Back to the blow, right to the low"
- Stand with back to wind, low pressure is on your right

**Application**: Quick method to locate low pressure from wind direction

### Pressure Gradient and Wind

**Isobars**: Lines of equal pressure (like contour lines)

**Wind Strength**: Proportional to isobar spacing
- Closer isobars = stronger wind

**Rule of Thumb for Pressure Changes**:
- 6mb drop in 3 hours ≈ Force 6
- 8mb drop in 3 hours ≈ Force 8
- Sharp rise also brings strong winds

**Geostrophic Wind**: Wind blowing along isobars (theoretical)

**Surface Wind**: ~2/3 of geostrophic speed, backed 15° over sea

### Global Pressure Patterns

**Equatorial Region:**
- **ITCZ** (Intertropical Convergence Zone): Band of low pressure near equator
- **Doldrums**: 5°N to 5°S, known for light/variable winds
- **Trade Winds**: Result from pressure bands combined with Coriolis effect

**Pressure Bands (Northern Hemisphere)**:
1. Equatorial Low (ITCZ)
2. Subtropical High
3. Subpolar Low
4. Polar High

**Seasonal Movement**:
- Pressure bands follow sun's declination
- Move north in northern summer, south in southern summer
- Affects trade wind and doldrum positions

### Wind Direction Memory Aid

**Northern Hemisphere**:
- Low pressure: Anticlockwise circulation
- High pressure: Clockwise circulation

**Southern Hemisphere**:
- Low pressure: Clockwise circulation
- High pressure: Anticlockwise circulation

### Sea State vs Swell

**Sea State**: Local wind-driven waves
- Describes roughness of local conditions
- Affected by wind strength and fetch

**Swell**: Distant-generated waves traveling into area
- Can arrive from far-off weather systems
- Long wavelength, regular pattern

**Combination Effects**:
- Little swell + rough sea = exciting sailing
- Smooth sea + 4m swell = usually manageable
- Rough sea + 4m swell (especially breaking) = dangerous

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Confusing NH and SH circulation directions
❌ Misapplying Buys Ballot's Law (left vs right)
❌ Using geostrophic wind speed directly instead of surface wind
❌ Overlooking pressure change rates as wind indicators
❌ Underestimating swell effects on sea conditions
❌ Forgetting that surface wind is backed 15° from isobars

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Predict wind direction around pressure systems in both hemispheres
- Apply Buys Ballot's Law to locate low pressure
- Estimate wind strength from pressure gradient
- Explain global pressure band formation
- Evaluate sea conditions from swell/sea state combination
- Calculate surface wind from geostrophic wind

### Practical Application

**Scenario**: Synoptic chart shows low pressure 100nm to west, isobars 30nm apart

1. **Your location**: East of low (Northern Hemisphere)
2. **Buys Ballot**: Back to wind, low is left → Wind from south
3. **Isobar spacing**: 30nm = moderately close
4. **Estimated wind**: Force 5-6
5. **Movement**: If low tracks east, expect increasing wind then veer to SW

**Scenario**: Southern Hemisphere, wind from northwest

1. **Buys Ballot (SH)**: Back to wind, low is RIGHT
2. **Conclusion**: Low pressure to northeast
3. **Circulation**: Clockwise around low
4. **Expect**: Wind to back (change anticlockwise) as system passes
