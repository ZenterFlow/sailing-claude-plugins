## Purpose

Construct comprehensive pilotage plans using pictorial/sketch or rolling road methods, incorporating all critical navigation data for safe deck-level execution.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you ask about:
- Pilotage planning methods
- Pictorial or sketch plans
- Rolling road plans or tram lines
- How to create pilotage plans
- Deck execution planning

## Behavior

### Required Information Checklist

Before creating any pilotage plan, research and compile:

**Tidal Data:**
- Heights of tide for entire period (hourly quick reference)
- Reference port tide tables for tidal streams
- State of tide at all times (know flow direction when possible)

**Port Information:**
- Entry limitations and restrictions
- Departure port details
- International port traffic signals used
- Communication channels and procedures (VHF)

**Visual Navigation Aids:**
- Leading lights and transits
- Depth contours for safe corridors
- Buoyage positions and characteristics
- Useful charted marks (spires, towers, distinctive buildings)

**Route Details:**
- Hazards and obstruction locations
- Speed limits and local regulations
- Waypoints with verification methods
- Distances and estimated arrival times
- Overall passage time calculations

### Method 1 - Pictorial/Sketch Plan

**Format**: Bird's eye view drawing of area (matches chart perspective)

**Creation Process**:
1. Copy relevant chart section onto paper
2. Add all buoys, marks, and hazards
3. Mark compass courses between each leg (magnetic)
4. Add bearings, distances, minimum depths
5. Include visual confirmation points

**Advantages**:
- Visual representation matches chart perspective
- Easy to orient with real-world view
- Natural understanding of spatial relationships

**Deck Use**:
- Keep in plastic sleeve for wet conditions
- Clip to cockpit for easy reference
- Orient to match real-world view

### Method 2 - Rolling Road Plan

**Format**: Linear track from bottom to top of page (like strip map)

**Creation Process**:
1. Draw single line representing vessel track
2. Mark start point at bottom of page
3. Work upward adding key information in sequence
4. Include buoys, marks, hazards, courses, distances
5. Add depth constraints and verification bearings

**Variations**:

**Tram Lines**:
- Two parallel lines representing channel edges
- Shows boundaries clearly
- Easy to see position within channel

**River Detail**:
- Add riverbanks for reference
- Mark significant buildings
- Note navigation points along route

**Advantages**:
- Compact and pocket-sized
- Fits on small waterproof pad
- Sequential information matches progress
- Easy to follow step-by-step

### Standard Leg Format

Each leg should specify:

**Required Information**:
- **Course**: Magnetic heading (e.g., 277°M)
- **Distance**: To next waypoint in nautical miles
- **Visual Verification**: How to confirm waypoint arrival
- **Minimum Depth**: Charted depth + Height of Tide
- **Maximum Depth**: Expected depth range
- **Hazards**: Any dangers on this leg
- **Arrival Check**: Specific bearing or depth at waypoint
- **Next Action**: What to do upon reaching waypoint

**Example Leg**:
```
LEG 3: Entrance Channel
Course: 277°(M)
Distance: 2.5 nm
Min Depth: 5m + HOT = 7.3m
Max Depth: ~35m
Hazards: None
Arrival: When bearing to lighthouse is 230°(M), depth 8m
Action: Turn to 315°(M) for next leg
```

### Essential Principles

**Research Benefits**:
- Drawing plan consolidates area knowledge
- Forces detailed chart study
- Identifies potential problems in advance

**Memory Aid**:
- Process of creation aids recall
- Visual/kinesthetic learning
- Better retention than just reading

**Navigation Station**:
- Proper place is COCKPIT, not chart table
- Navigator must be on deck
- Direct visual observation essential

**Chart Protection**:
- NEVER take original charts on deck
- Never take almanac or pilot books on deck
- Use copies or simplified plans only

**Orientation**:
- Clearly mark north-up or head-up
- Indicate direction of travel
- Add compass rose if helpful

### Plan Continuity

**Mixed Navigation**:
- If trip includes offshore sections, plot occasional fixes on main chart
- Return to chart table when clear of pilotage area
- Keep big picture in mind

**Simple Fixes**:
- Use buoys, bearings, depths for quick position updates
- Plot on pilotage plan if space allows
- Transfer to main chart periodically

**Logbook Entries**:
- Record key information at waypoints
- Time, position, depth, observations
- Creates record for later review

### Emergency Procedures

**If Lost**:
- Stop boat near buoy/marker
- Re-establish position before proceeding
- Use all available methods (GPS, depth, bearings)

**If In Doubt**:
- Stop vessel immediately
- Fix position accurately
- Reassess situation before continuing

**Contingency**:
- Always include alternative routes in plan
- Note safe abort points
- Identify areas to heave-to if needed

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Creating plans too complex to follow on deck
❌ Forgetting to include Height of Tide in depth calculations
❌ Not marking orientation (north-up vs head-up)
❌ Taking original charts on deck in wet conditions
❌ Failing to include visual confirmation points for waypoints
❌ Not researching tidal streams for passage timing
❌ Making writing too small to read in cockpit
❌ Not protecting plan from water damage

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Compile complete information checklist for sample harbor entry
- Create pictorial plan from chart extract
- Create rolling road plan for river passage
- Convert plan information to magnetic bearings where required
- Execute plan in simulation, staying on deck
- Identify all required leg information

### Practical Application

**Scenario**: Create rolling road plan for river entrance

1. **Research**: Gather tidal data, buoyage, hazards, depths, regulations
2. **Format**: Draw vertical line on waterproof paper
3. **Start**: Mark entrance waypoint at bottom
4. **Add Legs**: Work upward with courses, distances, depths
5. **Buoys**: Mark each buoy with number and characteristics
6. **Depths**: Note minimum at each section with HOT added
7. **Verification**: Add arrival checks for each waypoint
8. **End**: Mark final destination (mooring/anchorage) at top

**Leg Example from Plan**:
```
START: Entrance Waypoint (bottom of page)
↑
LEG 1: 045°(M), 1.2nm, min 8m+HOT
Pass Green Buoy #3 to starboard
Depth check: 12m at buoy
↑
LEG 2: 060°(M), 0.8nm, min 5m+HOT
Red Buoy #4 to port
Church spire bears 130°(M) when abeam buoy
↑
LEG 3: 035°(M), 1.5nm, min 3m+HOT
Follow river channel, tram lines
Marina entrance ahead
