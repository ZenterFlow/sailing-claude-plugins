# SKILL: chart-plotter-operation
**RYA Yachtmaster – Chart Plotter Operation and Configuration**

## Purpose
Navigate chart plotter menus, configure display settings, set alarms, and interpret navigation data screens.

## Activation Triggers
- "chart plotter setup"
- "plotter alarms"
- "MOB function"
- "COG extension lines"

## Behaviour
**Startup Warning** (IMPORTANT!):
- Chart plotters show "aid to navigation" warning
- Emphasizes: NOT primary navigation source
- Recreational charts not required to match official updates
- **Must use paper charts** as primary

**Menu Navigation**:
- Hamburger menu (≡): Access all functions
- Key pages: Navigation, AIS, MOB, Settings, Alarms
- Explore all options during familiarization

**Extension Lines**:
**COG/HDG lines**: Show projected course/heading
- **Infinite**: Extends forever (can clutter screen)
- **Time-based**: Position after set time (e.g., 6 min, 12 min) ✅ BETTER
- Advantage: Predicts near-term position, clearer display
- Requires: Speed (SOG) and heading for accuracy

**Alarms Configuration**:

**XTE Alarm** (Cross Track Error):
- Triggers when off track beyond set distance
- Consider: Channel width, hazards, safety margin
- Typical settings:
  - Coastal: 0.2-0.5 miles
  - Harbor: 0.1 miles
  - TSS lanes: 0.1 miles (tight!)

**Arrival Alarm**:
- Triggers when within set distance of waypoint
- Consider: Approach speed, reaction time
- Typical: 0.1-0.2 miles for precise approaches

**MOB Function** (Man Overboard):
- Dedicated button marks current position as MOB
- Automatically sets waypoint
- May activate navigation back to MOB point
- **Critical**: Know location and operation method!

**Critical Teaching Points**:
1. "Startup warning isn't legal disclaimer - it's safety reminder"
2. "Time-based extension lines predict problems before they happen"
3. "XTE alarms must match channel width and hazards"
