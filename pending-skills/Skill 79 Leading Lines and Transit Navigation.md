# SKILL: Leading Lines and Transit Navigation (SKILL_79)

## Description
Execute precise navigation using charted and improvised leading lines for both day and night pilotage, including course correction techniques and compass deviation checks.

## Prerequisites
- Pilotage Fundamentals and Information Sources (SKILL_78)
- Leading Lights and Transits (SKILL_75)

## Learning Objectives
- Identify leading lines on charts and interpret bearing information
- Use day transits with prominent objects
- Navigate using leading lights at night
- Apply the lower light rule for course corrections
- Construct improvised transits from charted features
- Use transits for compass deviation checks

**Charted Transits**
- **Symbol:** Magenta line on chart with direction arrow
- **Bearing:** Always given as TRUE bearing toward the transit objects
- **Day Use:** Align prominent objects (cones, diamonds, church spires, chimneys)
- **Example:** "Chimney and church spire at Seaview in transit (048°) lead into quay"

**Leading Lights Operation**
- **Configuration:** Two lights at different heights (rear higher, front lower)
- **Light Sequences:** Distinct patterns to identify front vs rear
  - **Rear Light:** Typically Iso 4s (2 seconds lit, 2 seconds dark)
  - **Front Light:** Typically Iso 2s (1 second lit, 1 second dark)
- **Alignment:** When lights are vertically aligned, vessel is on transit line
- **Follow Bearing:** Maintain charted true bearing (e.g., 148°T) keeping lights aligned

**Course Correction Rule**
**The Lower Light Rule:** Always steer toward the lower light
- **Lower light left of higher light:** Turn left (port) to align
- **Lower light right of higher light:** Turn right (starboard) to align
- **Works for:** Both entering and leaving port

**Entering vs Leaving Applications**
- **Entering:** Line bow with higher (rear) light
- **Leaving:** Line stern with higher (rear) light and look over shoulder
- **Reversal:** Course correction direction reverses when leaving vs entering
- **Mnemonic:** Lower light position indicates direction to turn regardless of direction of travel

**Improvised Transits**
- **Creation:** Use any two prominent charted objects in suitable alignment
- **Advantage:** Custom navigation aid for specific destinations
- **Verification:** Test alignment against charted features
- **Chart Limitation:** Not marked as magenta line but usable if objects reliable

**Compass Deviation Check Using Transits**
1. Sail across established transit on various headings
2. Take compass bearing of transit line as you cross it
3. Compare compass reading to charted true bearing
4. **Deviation = Compass Bearing - (True Bearing ± Variation)**
5. Repeat on multiple headings to create deviation curve

**Leading Lines in Animation**
- Visualize alignment during day (objects) and night (lights)
- Monitor depth contours along transit line
- Add Height of Tide (HOT) to charted depths for accurate depth monitoring
- Use pilot plan with numbered legs, distances, and minimum depths

## Common Errors
- Turning wrong direction when lights misalign (away from lower light)
- Forgetting to reverse correction logic when leaving port
- Using charted true bearing directly with hand bearing compass
- Misidentifying front vs rear lights by light sequence
- Overcorrecting and oscillating around transit line

## Assessment
- Identify safe approach bearing from charted transit information
- Determine required turn from given light misalignment scenario
- Construct improvised transit using charted objects
- Explain course correction difference between entering and leaving
- Calculate compass deviation from transit bearing data
