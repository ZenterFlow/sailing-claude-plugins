# SKILL: Tidal Theory and Cycle Patterns

## Description
Understand the astronomical causes of tides and identify diurnal, semidiurnal, and mixed tidal patterns for passage planning.

## Prerequisites
- Basic earth/moon/sun orbital concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Explain gravitational interaction of Moon and Sun creating tides
- Distinguish spring vs neap tide formation and timing
- Identify three tidal patterns from observation/data
- Calculate lunar day length (24h 50min) and its effect on tide times

## Key Concepts
**Tidal Causes:**
- Moon's primary gravitational pull creates tidal bulge
- Sun's gravity enhances (spring) or opposes (neap) lunar effect
- Centrifugal force creates opposite-side tidal bulge

**Tidal Cycles:**
- **Spring tides:** Occur ~1-2 days after new/full moon (Sun-Moon aligned)
- **Neap tides:** Occur ~1-2 days after quarter moons (Sun-Moon 90°)
- **Intermediate:** Between spring and neap periods

**Tidal Patterns:**
- **Semidiurnal:** 2 HW and 2 LW daily of equal height (e.g., East Coast USA)
- **Diurnal:** 1 HW and 1 LW daily (e.g., Gulf of Mexico)
- **Mixed Semidiurnal:** 2 HW and 2 LW daily of unequal height

**Lunar Day:**
- 24 hours 50 minutes causes daily tide time delay
- Some calendar days have only 1 HW or 1 LW due to overlap

## Common Errors
- Confusing spring/neap timing with moon phases
- Assuming all locations have semidiurnal tides
- Forgetting tide times advance ~50 minutes daily

## Assessment
- Label tidal pattern type from 3 sample tide tables
- Predict spring/neap dates given new/full moon dates
- Explain why opposite side of Earth experiences a tide
