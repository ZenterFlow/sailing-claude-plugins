# Fire Safety, Prevention, and Extinguisher Management

## Purpose
Implement comprehensive fire prevention strategies, execute emergency fire response protocols, and maintain fire fighting equipment to protect vessel and crew from catastrophic fire events.

## Description
This skill covers extinguisher selection and placement, maintenance protocols, emergency fire response for engine/galley/cabin fires, fire prevention measures, and crew briefing requirements.

## Activation Triggers
Use this skill when you need to:
- Deploy appropriate fire fighting equipment for different fire classes
- Execute engine compartment fire protocol
- Apply fire prevention measures throughout vessel
- Select and size extinguishers correctly
- Maintain fire suppression systems

## Behaviour

### Fire Fighting Equipment Deployment

**Extinguisher Selection by Fire Type:**
- **Flammable Liquids (Fuel, Oil):** AFFF (foam) extinguisher
- **Electrical Fires:** Dry powder extinguisher
- **General Cabin Fires:** Dry powder extinguisher
- **Galley Fires:** Fire blanket (primary), dry powder (backup)
- **Engine Compartment:** Automatic extinguisher system or access hole for manual discharge

**Extinguisher Placement Requirements:**
- **Galley:** Fire blanket PLUS dry powder extinguisher
- **Each Cabin:** Fire blanket in cabins without alternative exit
- **Every Cabin:** Minimum one dry powder extinguisher sized to volume
- **Engine Compartment:** Automatic fire extinguisher system
- **Exits:** Dry powder extinguisher within reach of each exit point

**Extinguisher Maintenance Protocol:**
- **Annual Professional Service:** All extinguishers serviced every year by certified technician
- **Monthly Crew Check:** Tilt dry powder units, verify pressure gauge, inspect for damage
- **Replacement Criteria:** Replace immediately if pressure low, damaged, or after any discharge

### Emergency Fire Response Procedures

**Engine Compartment Fire (Critical Protocol):**
1. **NEVER OPEN ENGINE BAY** - Introducing oxygen causes flashback
2. **Shut Engine Down:** Stop fuel supply and engine
3. **Activate Automatic System:** If fitted, allow automatic extinguisher to discharge
4. **Manual Discharge:** Use access hole to fire manual extinguisher into compartment
5. **Evacuate Area:** Keep crew away from compartment
6. **Prepare Abandon Ship:** If fire uncontrollable, launch life raft

**Galley Fire Response:**
1. **Fire Blanket First:** Smother flames (cut off oxygen)
2. **Shut Off Gas:** Turn off cooker and galley gas valve
3. **Extinguisher Backup:** Use dry powder if blanket insufficient
4. **Ventilate After:** Once fire out, ventilate area completely

**Cabin Fire Protocol:**
1. **Alert Crew:** Sound alarm and assign roles
2. **Evacuate Cabin:** Ensure no persons trapped
3. **Close Door:** Contain fire and reduce oxygen
4. **Discharge Extinguisher:** Use appropriate type through doorway
5. **Check for Spread:** Inspect adjacent compartments

### Fire Prevention Measures

**Structural Precautions:**
- Install fire flaps over all air intakes to engine/generator compartments
- Ensure pipe lagging is secure and fireproof
- Provide extinguisher access holes into engine/generator spaces
- Use fire retardant fabrics for upholstery and curtains

**Operational Precautions:**
- **NO SMOKING BELOW DECKS** - Absolute rule
- **Galley Supervision:** Never leave cooking unattended
- **Flammable Liquid Storage:** DO NOT stow paint, thinners, or solvents on board
- **Electrical Maintenance:** Keep all wiring and equipment well maintained
- **Fuel Filling:** Fill tanks to 7/8 maximum to prevent splash-back

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Opening engine compartment during fire (catastrophic flashback risk)
- Using wrong extinguisher type (water on electrical fire)
- Storing flammable liquids below decks
- Failing to service extinguishers annually
- Overloading galley power circuits
- Not having fire blanket in each cabin

## Assessment Criteria

Competency demonstrated by:
- Demonstrating correct extinguisher selection for fuel, electrical, and galley fires
- Executing engine compartment fire drill without opening bay
- Performing monthly dry powder extinguisher check
- Identifying all fire blankets and extinguishers with correct usage protocols
- Explaining why fire flaps are critical
- Briefing crew on fire evacuation routes and muster procedures
