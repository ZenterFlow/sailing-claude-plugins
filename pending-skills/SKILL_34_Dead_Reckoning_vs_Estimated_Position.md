# SKILL: Dead Reckoning vs Estimated Position

## Description
Distinguish between dead reckoning (DR) and estimated position (EP) plotting, and construct an EP by applying tidal vectors and leeway to a DR position.

## Prerequisites
- Chart plotting fundamentals
- Tidal stream vector plotting (SKILL_31)

## Learning Objectives
- Plot a DR position from course and distance
- Apply tidal vectors correctly to DR
- Distinguish DR from EP and explain when each is used
- Construct EP for 0.5 or 1 hour intervals
- Plot the circle of error for EP reliability

## Key Procedures
**DR Plotting:**
1. Plot starting position (fix, GPS, or previous EP)
2. Convert compass course to True (apply variation/deviation)
3. Apply leeway (downwind for EP plotting)
4. Draw water track line and mark distance run
5. This is the DR position (no tide applied)

**EP Construction:**
1. From DR position, plot tidal vector (direction and distance)
2. End of tidal vector = EP (shows where vessel actually is)
3. EP represents best estimate of actual position

**Circle of Error:**
- Radius = 10% of accumulated distance traveled
- Increases with each DR/EP leg
- Provides safety margin for uncertainty
- Should be backed up with visual fixes when possible

**Timing:**
- Use 0.5 or 1 hour intervals for easier tidal calculations
- Match tidal stream atlas hour intervals

## Common Errors
- Confusing DR (no tide) with EP (tide applied)
- Applying leeway incorrectly (wrong direction)
- Forgetting 10% error circle
- Using wrong time interval for tidal data

## Assessment
- Plot DR and EP for 1-hour run with &lt;0.5 NM error
- Correctly apply tidal vector to DR position
- Draw accurate error circle for multi-leg track
- Explain difference between DR and EP in navigation log
