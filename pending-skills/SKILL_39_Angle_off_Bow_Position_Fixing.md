# SKILL: Angle Off Bow Position Fixing

## Description
Use relative bearings of 45° and 90° to a charted object to determine distance off and approximate position without plotting bearing lines.

## Prerequisites
- Course maintenance
- Log reading

## Learning Objectives
- Identify when object is 45° relative to vessel's bow
- Identify when object is 90° relative (abeam)
- Calculate distance run between 45° and 90° bearings
- Apply principle: distance run = distance off at 90°
- Assess tidal influence on fix accuracy

## Method
**Setup:**
1. Maintain steady course (CRITICAL - no course changes)
2. Note log reading when object is 45° relative to bow
3. Prepare by pre-plotting 45° line from object if desired

**Execution:**
1. When object reaches 45° relative, note: time, log, course
2. Continue on same course
3. When object reaches 90° relative (abeam), note: time, log
4. Calculate distance run between bearings (log difference)

**Calculation:**
- Distance run = Distance off at 90° bearing
- No tidal correction: assumes tide effect is minimal over short run
- Example: Log at 45° = 2.0M, at 90° = 3.9M → Distance off = 1.9M

**Position Determination:**
- At 90° bearing, vessel is abeam of object at calculated distance
- Draw line perpendicular to course at distance off
- Intersection with object bearing line = position

**Tidal Consideration:**
- Fix is approximation (no tide accounted)
- Most accurate for short runs (&lt;30 minutes)
- Good for estimating distance offshore
- Combine with depth for improved accuracy

## Common Errors
- Changing course between bearings (invalidates fix)
- Misidentifying 45° and 90° moments
- Using log speed instead of distance run
- Forgetting to maintain steady heading

## Assessment
- Execute angle method with &lt;0.3 NM error compared to GPS
- Calculate distance off from given log readings
- Explain why course must remain steady
- Assess fix accuracy limitations
