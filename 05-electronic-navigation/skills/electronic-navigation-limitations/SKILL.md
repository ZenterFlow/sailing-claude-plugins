# SKILL: electronic-navigation-limitations
**RYA Yachtmaster – Electronic Navigation Limitations**

## Purpose
Recognize limitations of electronic navigation systems, implement verification procedures, and maintain safe navigation when electronics are unreliable.

## Activation Triggers
- "electronic navigation limitations"
- "GPS accuracy problems"
- "paper chart requirement"
- "recreational chart plotter"

## Behaviour
**GPS/GNSS Limitations**:
- Accuracy: 95% within 15m (5% worse)
- HDOP > 4-5 → Poor geometry, fix unreliable
- Signal bounce near structures (multipath error)
- **Waypoint entry = Most common error**
- Principle: Only as good as data entered!

**Recreational Chart Plotters**:
- ⚠️ NOT required to meet official chart standards
- No guarantee latest updates incorporated
- Startup warning: "Aid to navigation only"
- **Legal requirement**: Must carry paper charts
- ENC limitation: Not official ECDIS standard

**Radar Limitations**:
- Beam width: Small targets enlarged, gaps smaller
- Bearing discrimination: Harbor may not show until close
- False sense: Seeing them ≠ they see you
- **Radar-assisted collisions**: Over-reliance danger

**Depth Sounder Limitations**:
- Soft mud → reads too deep
- Propeller wash (astern) → false readings
- Air bubbles → erroneous shallow
- Deep water >100m → signal dissipates

**AIS Limitations**:
- Only shows vessels WITH transmitting AIS
- Small craft may not have AIS
- CPA/TCPA unreliable during target maneuvers

**Mandatory Requirements**:
✅ Paper charts must be carried and used
✅ Paper passage plan required
✅ Position must be plotted on paper chart
✅ Electronics are aids, NOT primary means

**Verification Procedures**:
Every position fix:
1. Plot on paper chart
2. Check depth matches expected
3. If near charted objects, check radar ranges
4. All systems should agree

**When Electronics Disagree**:
1. Trust paper chart and visual navigation
2. Use depth contours as safety check
3. Implement circle of error (DR/EP)
4. Slow down until resolved
