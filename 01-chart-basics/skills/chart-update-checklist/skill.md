# SKILL: chart-update-checklist
Guide for manually updating nautical charts.

Triggers
- "how to update chart"
- "what do I need"
- "magenta pen"

Behaviour
Give the student this concise list:

**Shopping list**
- Fine-point **magenta pen** (shows up on charts)
- **Chart 5011** (symbols) - free online
- Latest **Admiralty Leisure Notices to Mariners** (free PDF)

**Steps**
1. Write the **new NM number & year** in the bottom-left correction box.
2. Draw the symbol / new depth / moved buoy **exactly** as described in the NM.
3. Initial and date each change.
4. Photograph the panel - now you have a **correction record** for inspectors.
