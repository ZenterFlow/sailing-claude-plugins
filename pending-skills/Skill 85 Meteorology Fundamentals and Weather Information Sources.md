# SKILL: Meteorology Fundamentals and Weather Information Sources (SKILL_85)

## Description
Master the fundamentals of marine meteorology, identify reliable weather information sources, and understand the hierarchy of forecasts from global to local scales.

## Prerequisites
- Basic navigation planning concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Define meteorology and its importance to navigation
- Identify multiple weather information sources and their access methods
- Evaluate forecast suitability for different passage types
- Understand GRIB files and computer forecasting models
- Apply weather data collection and logging practices

**Core Concepts**
Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere. For navigators, it's about gathering correct data to forecast weather suitability for passages. Forecast selection is based on information availability and required forecast length.

**Weather Information Sources**

**Shipping Forecast:**
- **Access:** Marine radio, commercial/public radio, NAVTEX, internet websites/apps
- **Schedule:** Listed in local almanac (e.g., page 27 of RYA Almanac)
- **Format:** Standardized bulletin with gale warnings, synopsis, sea area forecasts
- **Coverage:** Specific sea areas (maps in almanac/chart agency booklets)
- **Validity:** Typically 24 hours from issue time
- **Best For:** Local passages, open coastlines, longer-term planning when monitored over time

**Inshore Waters Forecast:**
- **Access:** Same channels as shipping forecast
- **Coverage:** Fixed coastline stretches delimited by headlands/ports/estuaries
- **Advantage:** Accounts for local effects
- **Best For:** Short local passages, supplementing shipping forecast

**Maritime Safety Information (MSI) Broadcasts:**
- **Content:** Safety of navigation information, weather warnings
- **Access:** Marine radio, NAVTEX, other maritime comms systems
- **Schedule:** Available in almanac or online
- **Best For:** Short-term planning, local area updates

**Synoptic Charts / Surface Pressure Charts:**
- **Access:** Online, apps, fax, print
- **Data Source:** Thousands of observations (surface & upper air)
- **Update Frequency:** Several times daily at internationally agreed times
- **Content:** High/low pressure systems, fronts, isobars, pressure gradients
- **Best For:** Medium to long-term planning (3-5 days), understanding weather system movement

**Computer Forecasting Models:**
- **GFS (Global Forecast System):**
  - **Source:** NOAA/NCEP
  - **Resolution:** 18 miles (up to 16 days), 44 miles (1-2 weeks)
  - **Coverage:** Global
- **ECMWF (European Centre):**
  - **Operation:** European supercomputer complex
  - **Data:** World's largest NWP archive

**GRIB Files:**
- **Format:** Highly compressed binary weather data
- **Access:** Websites, GRIB reader apps, email
- **Resolution:** ~100NM for free versions, higher resolution available
- **Best For:** Offshore planning, trend analysis, 3-5 day forecasts
- **Limitations:** Less suitable for short-term local planning

**Live Observations:**
- **Sources:** ODAS buoys, ship reports, automatic weather stations, drifting buoys
- **Advantage:** Real-time data supplements forecasts
- **Considerations:** May be affected by local influences, shelter, or exposure

**Forecast Evaluation Criteria**
1. **Suitability:** Is source appropriate for marine weather?
2. **Coverage:** Does it cover proposed route area?
3. **Completeness:** Does it include all required information?
4. **Timeliness:** When was it issued? When does it cover?
5. **Timeframe:** Suitable for short/medium/long-term planning?
6. **Validation:** Are other forecasts available for comparison?

**Data Collection in Ship's Log**
Record every log entry:
- Barometric pressure
- Wind speed and direction
- Sea state
- Cloud type and cover
- Visibility
- Temperature

**Standing Orders Weather Criteria**
Crew should wake skipper for:
- Change in wind speed
- Wind direction change affecting course
- Visibility decreasing
- Barometric change &gt;7mb in 3 hours
- Worsening sea state
- Imminent weather warning

**PredictWind Professional Features**
Optional upgrade provides:
- High resolution (1km) models
- Model validation tools
- Tidal streams and ocean currents
- Live observations
- Satellite imagery and rain radar
- Optimal passage routing
- Departure time planning

## Common Errors
- Using non-marine forecasts (newspaper/TV) for offshore planning
- Relying on outdated forecasts (&gt;24 hours old)
- Not cross-referencing multiple sources
- Confusing synoptic scale with local conditions
- Failing to record barometric trends

## Assessment
- Identify appropriate forecast source for given passage type
- Evaluate forecast validity and timeframe
- Extract key information from shipping forecast
- Access and interpret GRIB files
- Establish weather logging and standing orders protocol
