# SKILL: Compass Dip and Heeling Error Awareness

## Description
Understand compass limitations due to magnetic dip and vessel heeling, and compensate for these errors in navigation.

## Prerequisites
- Compass fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
- Explain cause of magnetic dip
- Identify hemisphere-specific compass balancing
- Recognize heeling error conditions
- Minimize errors through proper technique

## Dip Principles
**Magnetic Dip:**
- Compass needle aligns with Earth's magnetic field lines
- Field lines curve into Earth at angles
- Northern hemisphere: north end points down (+dip)
- Southern hemisphere: south end points up (-dip)
- Range: -90° to +90° (poles to poles)

**Isoclinic Lines:**
- Lines of equal dip angle
- Magnetic equator = 0° dip (aclinic line)

**Compass Balancing:**
- Needles weighted for specific hemisphere/latitude
- Global compasses exist but expensive
- Improper balance → friction → sluggish response

## Heeling Error
**Cause:**
- Vertical magnetic forces get horizontal component when heeled
- Transverse horizontal forces get vertical component
- Creates deviation error proportional to heel angle

**Mitigation:**
- Keep vessel reasonably upright
- Error minimal at normal operating heel
- Significant in sailing vessels when hard on wind

## Common Errors
- Using northern hemisphere compass in southern waters
- Ignoring sluggish compass response as dip error sign
- Excessive heeling during critical compass work
- Not accounting for heeling error in deviation table

## Assessment
- Explain dip concept with diagram
- State hemisphere-specific balancing requirements
- Describe heeling error mitigation strategies
- Identify symptoms of dip-related compass malfunction
