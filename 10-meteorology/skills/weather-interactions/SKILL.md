## Purpose

Analyze interactions between multiple pressure systems, predict resulting wind patterns, and track low pressure system progression through different phases.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you ask about:
- Weather system interactions
- Frontal passages (warm/cold fronts)
- Depression lifecycle or development
- Squeeze zones between systems
- System progression and tracking

## Behavior

### System Interactions Overview

**Two High Pressure Systems Together:**
- **Between Systems**: Winds oppose each other
- **Result**: Area of reduced wind, variable direction
- **Within Systems**: Light winds, variable in centers (Col)
- **Navigation Strategy**: Best route through center of high for lighter conditions

**High and Low Pressure Together:**
- **Between Systems**: Systems drive each other, strongest winds in "squeeze zone"
- **NH Example** (Low left, High right):
  - Left of low: Strong NNW winds
  - Center of low: Variable winds
  - East of low: Very strong SSE winds
  - South of low: Strong WSW winds
- **SH Example**: Mirror image (strong southerlies between systems)
- **Navigation Strategy**: Avoid squeeze zone between systems

**Two Low Pressure Systems Together:**
- **Between Systems**: Winds oppose, creating lighter conditions
- **Within Systems**: Stronger winds expected between warm and cold fronts
- **Navigation Strategy**: Pass between lows for lighter winds, but avoid frontal zones

**Multiple System Interactions:**
- **Pattern**: Two highs and two lows create complex wind patterns
- **Center Area**: Light variable winds (Col region)
- **Escape Routes**: Between systems = stronger winds
- **Best Route**: Straight through high for lighter conditions

### Low Pressure System Development (NH)

**Formation Stage:**
- Warm moist air pushes into cold air along polar front
- Rising warm air creates surface pressure drop
- Initial spin begins anticlockwise (NH)

**Wave Stage:**
- Cold front and warm front develop
- "Warm sector" forms between fronts
- System deepens and matures

**Mature Depression:**
- Cold front travels faster than warm front
- Forces warm air to lift, deepening low
- Well-defined warm sector, cold front, warm front

### Weather Sequence (NH) - Straddling Warm Front

**Approach (Pre-Warm Front)**:
- Barometer falls
- Wind initially veers then backs
- High cirrus clouds (first sign)
- Clouds thicken to altostratus then nimbostratus
- Rain begins
- Visibility deteriorates

**Warm Front Passage**:
- Heavy rain, poor visibility
- Temperature rises
- Wind veers to southwest
- Barometer steadies

**Warm Sector**:
- Break in rain
- Temperature warmer
- Wind west-southwest, stronger but steady
- Possible drizzle, low dense cloud, fog
- Barometer steady

**Cold Front Approach**:
- Weather deteriorates rapidly
- Strong rain, very poor visibility
- Squalls and thunderstorms common
- Unstable conditions

**Cold Front Passage**:
- Wind veers sharply to northwest
- Barometer rises
- Temperature falls
- Patchy blue skies with showers
- Good visibility between showers
- Gusty conditions under clouds

### Key Indicators Table

| Phase | Barometer | Wind | Temperature | Clouds | Precipitation | Visibility |
|-------|-----------|------|-------------|--------|---------------|------------|
| Pre-Warm Front | Falling | Veers then backs | - | Cirrus→Altostratus→Nimbostratus | Increasing | Poor |
| Warm Sector | Steady | SW, steady | Warmer | Low dense, possible fog | Drizzle | Poor to moderate |
| Pre-Cold Front | Steady/falling | - | - | Building cumulus | Increasing | Poor |
| Post-Cold Front | Rising | Veers NW | Falling | Cumulus showers | Showers | Good between showers |

### Southern Hemisphere Differences

**Circulation**: Clockwise around low (opposite NH)

**Wind Shifts**: Backing instead of veering through fronts

**Sequence**: Mirror image but same cloud/precipitation patterns

### Barometric Pressure Monitoring

**Normal Trend**: Gradual changes with system movement

**Warning Signs**:
- >6mb drop in 3 hours = Force 6 warning
- >8mb drop in 3 hours = Force 8 warning
- Sharp rise also indicates strong winds
- Quick rise after low = stronger blow coming

### Practical Application: Chart Analysis

**Step-by-Step Process**:
1. **Locate Systems**: Identify high and low centers
2. **Draw Wind Arrows**: Apply hemisphere circulation rules
3. **Assess Your Position**: Where are you relative to systems?
4. **Predict Movement**: Note system speed/direction from forecast
5. **Time Your Transit**: Plan to avoid worst conditions

### System Speed Definitions

- **Slowly**: 0-15 knots
- **Steadily**: 15-25 knots
- **Rather rapidly**: 25-35 knots
- **Rapidly**: 35-45 knots
- **Very rapidly**: 45+ knots

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Confusing veering/backing direction through frontal passage
❌ Misplacing wind direction relative to low pressure center
❌ Forgetting that cold front moves faster than warm front
❌ Not accounting for squeeze zones between systems
❌ Ignoring barometric rate of change warnings
❌ Not recognizing warm sector characteristics

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Plot wind arrows on synoptic chart for given system configuration
- Predict wind direction/strength at specific location between systems
- Describe cloud/precipitation sequence for vessel passing through low
- Calculate expected barometric change rate and interpret
- Plan passage route avoiding strongest wind zones
- Identify depression lifecycle stage from chart

### Practical Application

**Scenario**: NH, low pressure 150nm west moving east at 20kn, high to southeast

1. **Current**: In squeeze zone between systems
2. **Wind**: Strong southerly (systems driving each other)
3. **Movement**: Low approaching at 20kn = 7-8 hours to arrival
4. **Sequence**: Expect warm front, warm sector, then cold front
5. **Action**: Reef early, prepare for frontal passages

**Scenario**: Between two lows, 200nm apart

1. **Position**: Midway between systems
2. **Wind**: Light and variable (opposing winds cancel)
3. **Strategy**: Can motor through, but watch for frontal zones
4. **Timing**: Move quickly before systems interact further
