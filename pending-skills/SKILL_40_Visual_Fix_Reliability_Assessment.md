# SKILL: Visual Fix Reliability Assessment

## Description
Evaluate the reliability of visual fixes based on position line geometry, object selection, and environmental factors.

## Prerequisites
- Chart plotting
- Position line techniques

## Learning Objectives
- Assess fix quality based on intersection angles
- Select optimal charted objects for position lines
- Identify unreliable bearing sectors
- Apply depth and contours to verify fixes
- Determine when to update EP with visual fix

## Reliability Factors
**Position Line Geometry:**
- **Optimal:** 60°-90° intersection angles (wide separation)
- **Poor:** &lt;30° or &gt;150° (narrow or wide angles)
- **Dangerous:** 180° (transit) gives line only, not fix

**Object Selection Criteria:**
- **Good:** Close to vessel, sharply defined, charted
- **Excellent:** Lighthouse, point, stack (precise)
- **Poor:** Hill summit, vague coastline
- **Avoid:** Objects near beam (parallel to course)

**Bearing Web Issues:**
- Near-parallel bearings create unreliable sector
- Bearings converge near waypoint → small errors magnified
- Solution: Use multiple objects with wide separation

**Verification Techniques:**
- **Depth check:** Compare (charted depth + tide) to echo sounder
- **Contour crossing:** Note when depth matches expected contour
- **GPS backup:** Use satellite fix to confirm visual fix
- **Radar verification:** Ranges/bearings to confirm charted objects

**Circle of Error Update:**
- Visual fix should replace EP if reliable
- New error circle centered on fix
- Radius = 10% of distance since last fix
- Fixes should be taken at every opportunity in poor visibility

## Common Errors
- Using objects too far away (bearing spread inaccurate)
- Accepting fix with poor intersection angles
- Ignoring depth discrepancies
- Not updating EP with reliable visual fix
- Forgetting to adjust depth for tide

## Assessment
- Evaluate 5 sample fixes and rank by reliability
- Select optimal 3 objects from chart for given position
- Verify a visual fix using depth and tidal height
- Demonstrate when to reject poor-quality fix
