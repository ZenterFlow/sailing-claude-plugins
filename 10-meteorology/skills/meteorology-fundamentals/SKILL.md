## Purpose

Master the fundamentals of marine meteorology, identify reliable weather information sources, and understand the hierarchy of forecasts from global to local scales.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you ask about:
- Meteorology fundamentals
- Weather information sources (shipping forecast, GRIB, etc.)
- Forecast evaluation criteria
- Weather data logging
- Standing weather orders

## Behavior

### Core Concepts

**Meteorology Definition**: The study of the atmosphere

**For Navigators**: Gathering correct data to forecast weather suitability for passages

**Forecast Selection**: Based on information availability and required forecast length

### Weather Information Sources

**Shipping Forecast:**
- **Access**: Marine radio, commercial/public radio, NAVTEX, internet websites/apps
- **Schedule**: Listed in local almanac (e.g., page 27 of RYA Almanac)
- **Format**: Standardized bulletin with gale warnings, synopsis, sea area forecasts
- **Coverage**: Specific sea areas (maps in almanac/chart agency booklets)
- **Validity**: Typically 24 hours from issue time
- **Best For**: Local passages, open coastlines, longer-term planning when monitored over time

**Inshore Waters Forecast:**
- **Access**: Same channels as shipping forecast
- **Coverage**: Fixed coastline stretches delimited by headlands/ports/estuaries
- **Advantage**: Accounts for local effects
- **Best For**: Short local passages, supplementing shipping forecast

**Maritime Safety Information (MSI) Broadcasts:**
- **Content**: Safety of navigation information, weather warnings
- **Access**: Marine radio, NAVTEX, other maritime comms systems
- **Schedule**: Available in almanac or online
- **Best For**: Short-term planning, local area updates

**Synoptic Charts / Surface Pressure Charts:**
- **Access**: Online, apps, fax, print
- **Data Source**: Thousands of observations (surface & upper air)
- **Update Frequency**: Several times daily at internationally agreed times
- **Content**: High/low pressure systems, fronts, isobars, pressure gradients
- **Best For**: Medium to long-term planning (3-5 days), understanding weather system movement

**Computer Forecasting Models:**

**GFS (Global Forecast System)**:
- **Source**: NOAA/NCEP
- **Resolution**: 18 miles (up to 16 days), 44 miles (1-2 weeks)
- **Coverage**: Global

**ECMWF (European Centre)**:
- **Operation**: European supercomputer complex
- **Data**: World's largest NWP archive

**GRIB Files:**
- **Format**: Highly compressed binary weather data
- **Access**: Websites, GRIB reader apps, email
- **Resolution**: ~100NM for free versions, higher resolution available
- **Best For**: Offshore planning, trend analysis, 3-5 day forecasts
- **Limitations**: Less suitable for short-term local planning

**Live Observations:**
- **Sources**: ODAS buoys, ship reports, automatic weather stations, drifting buoys
- **Advantage**: Real-time data supplements forecasts
- **Considerations**: May be affected by local influences, shelter, or exposure

### Forecast Evaluation Criteria

Apply these 6 questions to any forecast:

1. **Suitability**: Is source appropriate for marine weather?
2. **Coverage**: Does it cover proposed route area?
3. **Completeness**: Does it include all required information?
4. **Timeliness**: When was it issued? When does it cover?
5. **Timeframe**: Suitable for short/medium/long-term planning?
6. **Validation**: Are other forecasts available for comparison?

### Data Collection in Ship's Log

**Record every log entry:**
- Barometric pressure
- Wind speed and direction
- Sea state
- Cloud type and cover
- Visibility
- Temperature

**Purpose**: Build barometric trend analysis, validate forecasts

### Standing Orders Weather Criteria

**Crew should wake skipper for:**
- Change in wind speed
- Wind direction change affecting course
- Visibility decreasing
- Barometric change >7mb in 3 hours
- Worsening sea state
- Imminent weather warning

### PredictWind Professional Features

**Optional upgrade provides:**
- High resolution (1km) models
- Model validation tools
- Tidal streams and ocean currents
- Live observations
- Satellite imagery and rain radar
- Optimal passage routing
- Departure time planning

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Using non-marine forecasts (newspaper/TV) for offshore planning
❌ Relying on outdated forecasts (>24 hours old)
❌ Not cross-referencing multiple sources
❌ Confusing synoptic scale with local conditions
❌ Failing to record barometric trends
❌ Not establishing standing orders for weather changes

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Identify appropriate forecast source for given passage type
- Evaluate forecast validity and timeframe
- Extract key information from shipping forecast
- Access and interpret GRIB files
- Establish weather logging and standing orders protocol
- Apply 6-question forecast evaluation process

### Practical Application

**Scenario**: Planning 3-day offshore passage

1. **Primary Source**: Synoptic charts for system movement (3-5 day view)
2. **Supplementary**: GRIB files for wind/wave trends
3. **Validation**: Shipping forecast for current conditions
4. **Local**: Inshore forecast for departure and arrival harbors
5. **Live Data**: ODAS buoy observations for actual conditions
6. **Evaluation**: Apply 6 criteria to each source

**Scenario**: Day sail along coast

1. **Primary**: Inshore waters forecast (accounts for local effects)
2. **Supplementary**: Shipping forecast for broader context
3. **Timeliness**: Check issue time (<6 hours old preferred)
4. **Live Data**: Local weather stations for current conditions
