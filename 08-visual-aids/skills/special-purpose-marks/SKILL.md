## Purpose

Identify and interpret isolated danger marks, safe water marks, special marks, and temporary wreck markers that provide specific hazard or boundary information beyond channel marking.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you ask about:
- Isolated danger marks or safe water marks
- Special marks or their purposes
- Wreck markers or fairway buoys
- Mark identification from color schemes
- Passage rules for special navigation marks

## Behavior

### Isolated Danger Mark

**Purpose**: Marks isolated hazard with navigable water all around; provides no information on danger size

**Appearance**: Black with red horizontal band(s)

**Shape**: Pillar, spar, or buoy (any shape)

**Topmark**: Two black balls (one above the other)

**Light**:
- Color: White
- Sequence: Fl(2)4s (2 white flashes within 4 seconds)

**Rule**: Keep well clear - hazard directly below mark

**Key Point**: Navigable water exists on all sides, but pass with adequate clearance

### Safe Water Mark (Fairway Buoy)

**Purpose**: Indicates safe open water, clear of hazards; marks estuary/marina entrance transition

**Appearance**: Red and white vertical stripes (preferably spherical)

**Shape**: Spherical or pillar

**Topmark**: Single red sphere (if fitted)

**Light**:
- Color: White
- Sequence Options:
  - Occulting (more light than dark)
  - Isophase (equal light/dark periods)
  - Morse Code (A): • —
  - Long flash every 10 seconds (L Fl 10s)
- Example: Iso.4s (even 4-second light/dark cycle)

**Rule**: Marks safe passage area - can pass on either side, but remain vigilant

**Use**: Mid-channel mark or landfall buoy

### Special Mark

**Purpose**: Indicates special areas or features

**Types**:
- Pipelines or cables
- Race courses
- Protected areas
- Commercial zones
- Spoil grounds
- Military exercise areas

**Appearance**: Yellow (single color)

**Shape**: Any shape (usually appropriate for local buoyage direction)

**Topmark**: Single yellow cross (X)

**Light**:
- Color: Yellow
- Sequence: Any sequence distinct from other marks
- Example: Fl(4)Y.10s (4 yellow flashes within 10 seconds)

**Rule**: Check chart information box for specific purpose and restrictions

### Temporary Wreck Marker

**Purpose**: Marks recent wreck location (introduced relatively recently to IALA system)

**Appearance**: Blue and yellow vertical stripes

**Shape**: Pillar or spar

**Light**: Alternating blue and yellow

**Rule**: Keep well clear - position may be approximate

**Note**: Distinct from isolated danger mark (different colors)

### Key Distinctions Table

| Mark Type | Colors | Topmark | Light | Passage Rule |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------|--------------|
| **Isolated Danger** | Black/red bands | Two balls | Fl(2) white | Pass with clearance |
| **Safe Water** | R/W vertical stripes | Sphere | Iso/Oc/Morse A | Safe passage either side |
| **Special** | Yellow | Cross (X) | Any yellow | Chart reference |
| **Wreck** | Blue/yellow stripes | None | Alt Y/B | Keep clear |

### Light Sequence Clues

**Fl(2) White**: Isolated danger - 2 flashes identify the hazard
**Isophase/Occulting White**: Safe water - steady rhythm indicates safety
**Any Yellow sequence**: Special mark - consult chart
**Alternating Blue/Yellow**: Wreck marker - recent addition

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Confusing isolated danger with safe water marks
❌ Forgetting special marks require chart reference for specific meaning
❌ Assuming safe water mark means hazard-free without consulting chart
❌ Mistaking wreck marker for special mark due to yellow color
❌ Not keeping extra clearance around isolated danger marks

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Identify mark type from appearance and light sequence
- Determine appropriate action for each mark type
- Interpret special mark purpose using chart information
- Navigate safely around isolated danger
- Distinguish between similar-appearing marks

### Practical Application

**Scenario**: You spot a mark with black body, red horizontal band, and two balls topmark

1. **Identification**: Isolated danger mark
2. **Light check**: Should see Fl(2) white if equipped
3. **Action**: Alter course to pass with adequate clearance
4. **Chart**: Check for hazard details and depth

**Scenario**: Red and white vertical stripes, spherical shape

1. **Identification**: Safe water mark
2. **Meaning**: Open water, no immediate hazards
3. **Action**: Safe to pass either side, maintain lookout
4. **Context**: Likely marking channel entrance or mid-channel position
