# SKILL: Position Fixing Practical Integration

## Description
Integrate all positioning techniques (DR, EP, visual, GPS, depth) to maintain continuous accurate position awareness and update navigational plan.

## Prerequisites
- All positioning skills (SKILL_34-41)
- Tidal calculations (SKILL_27-33)

## Learning Objectives
- Determine most appropriate fix method for situation
- Transition between DR, EP, and visual fixes seamlessly
- Use depth as continuous position verification
- Update EP with visual fix and reset error circle
- Assess fix accuracy vs circle of error

## Situational Application
**Open Water Passage:**
- DR/EP between fixes
- Hourly EP updates with tidal data
- GPS fix every hour (visual may be limited)
- Depth check when crossing known contours

**Coastal Navigation:**
- Visual fix every 15-30 minutes when objects available
- Running fix when only one object visible
- Navigation web for harbor approach
- XTE ladder for narrow channels

**Poor Visibility/Fog:**
- DR/EP primary method
- Circle of error critical (10% distance)
- Depth monitoring essential
- Radar ranges if available
- GPS fix when reliable objects disappear

**Fix Updating Protocol:**
1. Obtain visual fix
2. Assess fix reliability (angles, objects, time)
3. If reliable: replace EP with fix
4. Reset error circle: radius = 10% of distance since fix
5. Continue DR/EP from new position

**Depth Integration:**
- Calculate total depth = charted depth + tide height
- Compare to echo sounder reading
- Sounder offset may apply (keel/hull/sea level)
- Calibrate with lead line when using new vessel
- Use as continuous "sanity check" on EP

## Common Errors
- Not resetting error circle after good fix
- Forgetting to apply tidal height to depth
- Using unreliable fix to replace accurate EP
- Failing to maintain EP when visual fixes unavailable
- Not calibrating depth sounder offset

## Assessment
- Complete 4-hour simulated passage maintaining position log
- Use minimum 3 different fix methods appropriate to conditions
- Demonstrate EP update after visual fix
- Show depth verification catching position error
- Explain fix method selection rationale
