# SKILL: Leeway Application for EP and CTS

## Description
Apply leeway correctly depending on navigation context: DOWNWIND for Estimated Position plotting vs INTO WIND for Course to Steer calculation.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of wind effect on vessel
- True course conversion (SKILL_21)

## Learning Objectives
- Differentiate leeway direction for EP vs CTS
- Estimate leeway angle from wind strength and vessel type
- Apply leeway to course steered for EP plotting
- Apply leeway to water track for CTS calculation
- Measure leeway using wake angle method

## Application Rules
**For Estimated Position (DR/EP Plotting):**
- **Apply DOWNWIND** (with wind direction)
- Wind pushes vessel off intended track
- Increases course over ground relative to heading
- **PORT wind:** Add leeway to True course
- **STARBOARD wind:** Subtract leeway from True course

**For Course to Steer (CTS Planning):**
- **Apply INTO WIND** (toward wind direction)
- Compensates for expected leeway in advance
- Decreases course to steer relative to desired track
- **PORT wind:** Subtract leeway from water track
- **STARBOARD wind:** Add leeway to water track

**Measurement Technique:**
- Take wake bearing astern
- Compare to reciprocal of heading
- Difference = leeway angle
- Typical values: 5°-15° for sailing vessels

**Example (EP Plotting):**
- Compass: 320°(M)
- Variation: 7°W → 313°(T)
- Wind: Westerly → on port side
- Leeway: 5°
- EP Course: 313° + 5° = 318°(T) (downwind)

## Common Errors
- Applying leeway in wrong direction for context
- Forgetting leeway entirely
- Confusing port/starboard wind application
- Using same leeway for all wind strengths

## Assessment
- Correctly apply leeway for 6 scenarios (3 EP, 3 CTS)
- Measure leeway from diagram with ±2° accuracy
- Explain directional logic without reference
- Identify wind side from given course change
