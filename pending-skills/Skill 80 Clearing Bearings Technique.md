# SKILL: Clearing Bearings Technique (SKILL_80)

## Description
Apply clearing bearings to maintain safe corridors between hazards, using hand bearing compass monitoring and tactical tacking to avoid dangers.

## Prerequisites
- Pilotage Fundamentals and Information Sources (SKILL_78)

## Learning Objectives
- Plot clearing bearings creating safe navigation corridors
- Apply "not less than" and "not more than" bearing limits
- Monitor hand bearing compass during approach
- Execute tacks at bearing limits
- Use clearing bearings at night with entrance lights

**Concept and Purpose**
Clearing bearings create a safe corridor between hazards by establishing bearing limits to a prominent object. The vessel stays between two plotted lines that are verified clear of all dangers.

**Plotting Clearing Bearings**
1. **Identify Prominent Object:** Choose distinct, charted feature (church spire, summit, lighthouse)
2. **Draw Two Lines:** Create corridor boundaries that keep vessel clear of all dangers
3. **Verify Safety:** Ensure entire area between lines is hazard-free
4. **Add Bearing Labels:**
   - "Not MORE than [bearing]°" - maximum bearing limit
   - "Not LESS than [bearing]°" - minimum bearing limit
5. **Convert to Magnetic:** Plot true bearings on chart, convert to magnetic for hand compass

**Verification Check**
- Use plotter to take bearing from hazard to object
- Confirm hazard bearing is outside (more/less than) clearing limits
- Double-check all bearings before use

**Monitoring Technique**
- **Hand Bearing Compass:** Use for continuous monitoring (reads magnetic only)
- **Frequency:** Check bearing regularly as you approach danger area
- **Decision Point:** When bearing reaches limit, execute tack immediately

**Tacking Sequence**
1. Approach danger area on initial heading
2. Monitor bearing to prominent object
3. **At "not more than" limit:** Tack to starboard (turn away from limit)
4. **At "not less than" limit:** Tack to port (turn away from limit)
5. Continue tacking between limits until clear of hazards

**Night Application**
- Use prominent harbor entrance lights instead of day objects
- **Port entrance light:** One clearing bearing
- **Starboard entrance light:** Second clearing bearing
- **Backup:** Monitor depth to confirm staying in safe corridor

**Single Clearing Bearing**
- **Use:** Keep vessel away from one side of channel or specific rock
- **Method:** Maintain bearing on one side only (either not less than OR not more than)
- **Advantage:** Simple monitoring for channel boundary keeping

**Depth Integration**
- **Safe Minimum Depth:** Additional check against standing into danger
- **Contour Following:** Use depth contours as secondary safety line
- **HOT Application:** Add Height of Tide to charted depths for accurate monitoring

**Example Scenario**
- **Not MORE than 030°(M):** Tack when bearing reaches or exceeds 030° magnetic
- **Not LESS than 350°(M):** Tack when bearing drops to or below 350° magnetic
- **Result:** Vessel stays safely between two rock groups near harbor entrance

## Common Errors
- Reversing "not more than" and "not less than" labels
- Using true bearings directly with hand bearing compass
- Waiting too long to tack after reaching bearing limit
- Plotting lines that allow hazards inside corridor
- Forgetting to add HOT when using depths for verification

## Assessment
- Plot clearing bearings for harbor entrance with hazards both sides
- Convert true bearings to magnetic for hand compass use
- Determine tack direction from given bearing reading
- Execute safe passage using clearing bearings in exercise
- Create night clearing bearing plan using entrance lights
