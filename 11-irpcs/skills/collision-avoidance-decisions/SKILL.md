# Collision Avoidance Decision Making

## Purpose
Execute correct collision avoidance actions based on vessel hierarchy, encounter type, and visibility conditions, applying the "turn to starboard" principle under IRPCS Rules 13-19.

## Description
This skill covers practical decision-making for collision avoidance including head-on, crossing, and overtaking situations, stand-on vessel responsibilities, restricted visibility rules, and multiple vessel encounters. Critical for safe navigation in all conditions.

## Activation Triggers
Use this skill when you need to:
- Apply correct action for head-on, crossing, and overtaking situations
- Execute stand-on vessel responsibilities properly
- Implement last-resort avoiding action
- Apply restricted visibility rules (Rule 19)
- Make correct decisions with multiple vessel encounters
- Use danger signals appropriately

## Behaviour

### The "Turn to Starboard" Principle

**Fundamental Rule:** When avoiding collision, turning to starboard is preferred because:
- Shows other vessel a different aspect (clear intention)
- Aligns with head-on passing rule (port-to-port)
- Avoids turning into the path of crossing vessel
- Standard expectation in international waters

### Head-On Situation (Rule 14)

**Vessels Meeting Nearly End-On:**
- **Both Vessels:** Alter course to STARBOARD
- **Result:** Pass port-to-port (left side to left side)
- **Action:** Early, substantial alteration
- **Signal:** 1 short blast (turning to starboard)
- **Alternative:** If passing starboard-to-starboard, 2 short blasts (port turn) - by agreement only

**Identifying Head-On:**
- See both sidelights (red and green)
- Vessel appears bow-on
- Masthead light(s) in line

### Crossing Situation (Rule 15)

**Vessel on Starboard Side (Give-Way):**
- **Status:** Give-way vessel
- **Action:** Alter course to avoid (preferably starboard)
- **May:** Slow down or stop if necessary
- **Signal:** Not specifically required but can use maneuvering signals
- **Must:** Take early and substantial action

**Vessel on Port Side (Stand-On):**
- **Status:** Stand-on vessel
- **Action:** Maintain course and speed
- **Vigilance:** Monitor give-way vessel's action continuously
- **Last Resort:** If give-way vessel fails to act, turn away obviously (Rule 17b)

**Identifying Crossing:**
- See one sidelight (red OR green)
- Other vessel not overtaking or head-on
- Risk of collision exists

### Overtaking Situation (Rule 13)

**Overtaking Vessel:**
- **Status:** Always give-way vessel, regardless of vessel type
- **Action:** Keep well clear of overtaken vessel
- **Signal:**
  - Starboard side: 1 short blast (intention to overtake)
  - Port side: 2 short blasts (intention to overtake)
- **Continue:** Give-way obligation continues until finally past and clear

**Overtaken Vessel:**
- **Status:** Stand-on vessel
- **Action:** Maintain course and speed
- **May:** Signal agreement (1 long-1 short-1 long-1 short)
- **Should Not:** Accelerate or alter course

**Determining Overtaking:**
- **Test:** Vessel more than 22.5° abaft the beam = overtaking
- **Responsibility:** Burden of proof on overtaking vessel
- **If Doubt Exists:** Assume overtaking situation

### Stand-On Vessel Responsibilities (Rule 17)

**Initial Action (Rule 17a):**
- **Maintain Course:** Hold current heading
- **Maintain Speed:** Do NOT slow down or speed up
- **Vigilance:** Watch give-way vessel's actions
- **Even If:** Other vessel is larger

**When Action Required (Rule 17b):**
- **Trigger:** Give-way vessel fails to take avoiding action
- **Last Resort:** When collision cannot be avoided by give-way vessel alone
- **Action:** Turn away deliberately and obviously
- **Direction:** Away from the other vessel
- **Speed:** May slow down or stop

**Prohibited Stand-On Actions:**
- **Do NOT:** Turn to port for vessel on own port side
- **Do NOT:** Make small, hesitant alterations
- **Do NOT:** Increase speed when being overtaken
- **Do NOT:** Take premature action before give-way vessel has opportunity

### Multiple Vessel Encounters

**Prioritization Process:**
1. **Identify Hierarchy:** NUC > RAM > CBD > Fishing > Sail > Power
2. **Determine Encounter:** Head-on, crossing, overtaking for each vessel
3. **Assign Roles:** Give-way vs stand-on for each pair
4. **Plan Action:** Starboard turn preferred for all give-way vessels
5. **Monitor All:** Keep track of multiple vessels simultaneously

**Complex Scenario Approach:**
- Identify highest priority vessel first (NUC/RAM)
- Determine your obligations to that vessel
- Assess secondary encounters
- Choose single maneuver that addresses all encounters
- Make action bold and obvious to all vessels

### Restricted Visibility Rules (Rule 19)

**Key Difference:** No stand-on/give-way designation in restricted visibility

**All Vessels Must:**
- **Proceed with Caution:** Safe speed for conditions
- **Detection:** By radar, sound, or other means
- **Action:** Positive avoiding action early
- **Speed:** Reduce to minimum for conditions if necessary

**Avoiding Action in Restricted Visibility:**
- **Power Vessels:** Turn to starboard if vessel ahead detected
- **Course Alteration:** Large enough to be obvious on radar
- **Speed Reduction:** Stop if necessary
- **Avoid:** Turn to port for vessel forward of beam (except overtaking)

**Sound Signals in Fog (Key Identifiers):**
- **1 Long:** Power vessel making way
- **2 Long:** Power vessel stopped (not making way)
- **1 Long + 2 Short:** Sail, RAM, NUC, Fishing, Towing
- **1 Long + 3 Short:** Last vessel in tow
- **4 Short:** Pilot vessel on duty
- **1 Short + 1 Long:** Diver down (Morse A)

### Danger Signal (Rule 34d)

- **Signal:** 5 or more short blasts
- **Meaning:** "I do not understand your intentions" or danger warning
- **Use:** When other vessel's actions are unclear or dangerous
- **Not Routine:** Only when genuine danger or confusion exists

### Last-Minute Avoiding Action

**When to Take:**
- Give-way vessel fails to act
- Stand-on vessel's safety requires action
- Collision imminent in 1-2 minutes

**How to Take:**
- **Direction:** Turn AWAY from other vessel
- **Magnitude:** Large, obvious alteration
- **Speed:** Reduce or stop if needed
- **Communication:** Use danger signal if appropriate (5 short blasts)
- **Full Astern:** If necessary to reduce speed quickly

**What to Avoid:**
- Small alterations (don't change aspect enough)
- Port turns for vessel on port side (confusing)
- Acceleration (especially when being overtaken)
- Last-second panic (should be deliberate, controlled action)

### Local Rules and Departures from IRPCS

**Port/Harbor Regulations:**
- **Application:** Local rules may apply in controlled waters
- **Status:** May override standard IRPCS requirements
- **Example:** Port traffic control instructions, designated ferry lanes

**Departure from IRPCS (Rule 2):**
- **Permitted:** To avoid immediate danger
- **Requirement:** Departure must be necessary and justified
- **Documentation:** Log reason for departure

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Turning to port instead of starboard in head-on situation
- Stand-on vessel taking premature action instead of maintaining course
- Overtaking vessel not keeping well clear
- Making small, hesitant alterations instead of bold changes
- Using danger signal (5 blasts) as routine communication
- Forgetting that restricted visibility eliminates stand-on/give-way status
- Not taking early enough action as give-way vessel

## Assessment Criteria

Competency demonstrated by:
- Determining correct action for head-on crossing situation
- Identifying proper overtaking procedure and signals
- Executing stand-on vessel responsibilities until last resort
- Applying restricted visibility rules and sound signals
- Navigating multiple vessel encounter with correct hierarchy
- Using danger signal appropriately in ambiguous situations
- Describing when departure from IRPCS is permissible
- Taking bold, early action as give-way vessel
