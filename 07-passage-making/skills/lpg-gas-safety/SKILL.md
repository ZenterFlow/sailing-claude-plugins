# LPG Gas System Safety Management and Leak Response

## Purpose
Manage LPG (butane/propane) systems safely on board vessels, including leak detection, emergency ventilation, proper storage, and preventive maintenance to eliminate explosion and fire risks.

## Description
This skill covers gas leak detection and response, proper ventilation techniques, gas storage requirements, system component standards, and fire prevention specific to LPG systems.

## Activation Triggers
Use this skill when you need to:
- Detect and respond to gas leaks
- Apply emergency ventilation procedures
- Maintain gas storage and system components
- Operate emergency shut-off systems
- Understand gas locker drainage requirements

## Behaviour

### Gas Leak Detection and Response

**Immediate Actions Upon Gas Smell Detection:**
1. **Ventilate Area:** Open all hatches, companionways, and ports immediately
2. **Eliminate Ignition Sources:**
   - DO NOT operate any electrical switches (lights, instruments, bilge pump)
   - DO NOT light matches, lighters, or any open flame
   - Extinguish all flames in galley
3. **Manual Ventilation:** Use manual bilge pump (note: limited effectiveness for gas)
4. **Secure Gas Supply:** Turn off at bottle and galley shut-off valve
5. **Evacuate if Necessary:** Remove crew from affected area until gas dissipates

### Gas System Maintenance Procedures

**Bottle Storage Requirements:**
- Store bottles ONLY in dedicated locker that drains externally overboard
- Modern vessels must have designated gas storage areas
- Never store bottles below deck without proper ventilation and drainage
- Check locker drain lines regularly for blockages

**System Component Standards:**
- Use ONLY approved gas hoses (check certification marks)
- Install shut-off valve in galley within easy reach of cook
- Route hoses to avoid chafe points and heat exposure
- Replace hoses at manufacturer-recommended intervals regardless of appearance

**Operational Safety:**
- Close galley shut-off valve when cooker not in use
- Check hose connections with leak detection fluid monthly
- Never use gas system while vessel is unattended
- Brief all crew on gas odor recognition and emergency procedures

### Fire Prevention Specific to Gas

- Keep gas locker free of paint, thinners, or other flammables
- Ensure fabrics near galley are fire retardant
- Install smoke alarm in galley area
- Never store gas bottles near engine compartment or electrical panels

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Using electrical bilge pump switches during gas leak (sparking risk)
- Storing gas bottles in lockers without external drainage
- Using non-approved hoses or failing to replace aged hoses
- Leaving galley shut-off valve open when cooker not in use
- Attempting to "disperse" gas with engine blower (can ignite)
- Storing flammable liquids in same locker as gas bottles

## Assessment Criteria

Competency demonstrated by:
- Executing gas leak response drill within 60 seconds of detection
- Demonstrating proper manual ventilation technique
- Identifying and testing all gas shut-off valves on vessel
- Inspecting gas hose routing and identifying any chafe risks
- Explaining why electrical switches must not be used during gas emergency
- Showing proper bottle storage locker drainage verification
