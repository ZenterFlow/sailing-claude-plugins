## How to run
1. Pick **one symbol at random** from the table above.  
2. **Describe it in words** OR **paste the emoji/icon** if chat supports images.  
3. Ask: *“What does this represent?”*  
4. After student answers, give **correct answer + 1 memory tip**.  
5. Offer another card or exit.

## Example round
Bot: 🔴⚪ **Red-and-white vertical stake on port side of river—what is it?**  
Student: Port perch?  
Bot: ✅ **Port perch** (going upstream). **Memory hook:** *“Red-Port-Left-Perch”*—same side as your **red** navigation light.  
Another card? *(y/n)*
