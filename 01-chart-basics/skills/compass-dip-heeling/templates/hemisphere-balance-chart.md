# Compass Hemisphere Balance Reference

## Quick Identification Guide

### How to Check Your Compass Balance

**Method 1: Markings on Compass**
Look for labels:
- "NH" or "Northern Hemisphere"
- "SH" or "Southern Hemisphere"
- "Zone 1" through "Zone 5"
- "Global" or "Universal"
- Latitude range (e.g., "30°N-60°N")

**Method 2: Manufacturer Documentation**
Check compass manual or manufacturer website with model number

**Method 3: Purchase Location**
- Compasses sold in UK/Europe/North America: Usually NH
- Compasses sold in Australia/New Zealand/South Africa: Usually SH
- Exception: Marine chandlers may stock both

## Common Sailing Routes and Compass Requirements

### Atlantic Crossings

**Northern Atlantic (UK to Caribbean)**
```
Route: Southampton (51°N) → Caribbean (15°N)

Start: Zone 2 (NH moderate balance)
Finish: Zone 3 (Equatorial)

Compass Strategy:
• Zone 2 compass works adequately throughout
• OR use Zone 3 (Universal) for both regions
• Performance slightly degraded in Caribbean but acceptable
```

**Southern Atlantic (Africa to South America)**
```
Route: Cape Town (34°S) → Buenos Aires (35°S)

Latitude: Stays in Zone 4 (SH moderate balance)

Compass Strategy:
• Zone 4 (SH) compass required
• NH compass would be sluggish and inaccurate
```

### Pacific Crossings

**Northern Pacific (California to Hawaii)**
```
Route: San Francisco (38°N) → Honolulu (21°N)

Start: Zone 2 (NH moderate balance)
Finish: Zone 3 (Equatorial)

Compass Strategy:
• Zone 2 compass acceptable throughout
• Zone 3 (Universal) optimal for both
```

**Coconut Milk Run (Panama to New Zealand)**
```
Route: Panama (9°N) → Various Pacific islands → Auckland (37°S)

Start: Zone 3 (Equatorial, +15° dip)
Finish: Zone 4 (SH, -63° dip)

Compass Strategy:
⚠️ CROSSES EQUATOR - CRITICAL
• NH compass fails in New Zealand (wrong hemisphere)
• Must use Zone 3 (Universal/Equatorial) OR
• Switch to Zone 4 (SH) compass after crossing equator
```

### World Circumnavigation

**Typical Route (West-About)**
```
Route:
UK (51°N, Zone 2) →
Atlantic (40-20°N, Zone 2-3) →
Caribbean (15°N, Zone 3) →
Panama Canal (9°N, Zone 3) →
Pacific (10°S-35°S, Zone 3-4) →
New Zealand (37°S, Zone 4) →
Southern Ocean (40-50°S, Zone 4) →
Cape of Good Hope (34°S, Zone 4) →
South Atlantic (25-35°S, Zone 4) →
North Atlantic (20-50°N, Zone 3-2) →
UK (51°N, Zone 2)

Compass Strategy:
OPTION 1: Global/Universal compass
  • Works adequately everywhere
  • Expensive (£300-800)
  • Single compass for whole voyage

OPTION 2: Two compasses
  • NH (Zone 2) for Northern Hemisphere
  • SH (Zone 4) for Southern Hemisphere
  • Switch at equator crossing
  • Cheaper than global (£150-300 total)
  • More accurate than global
  • Requires installation planning

Legend:
✓✓✓ = Ideal (compass balanced for this region)
✓   = Acceptable (will work with minor accuracy loss)
○   = Marginal (reduced accuracy, sluggish response)
✗   = Unsuitable (sluggish, unreliable, may bind)
```

## Symptoms of Wrong Hemisphere Compass

### NH Compass in SH Waters (or vice versa)
```
EARLY SYMPTOMS (within 10° of equator):
• Slightly sluggish response
• Card takes longer to settle after turn
• May not notice immediately

MODERATE SYMPTOMS (20-30° opposite hemisphere):
• Clearly sluggish movement
• Card appears to drag
• Difficulty maintaining steady reading
• Reduced sensitivity to small course changes

SEVERE SYMPTOMS (40-60° opposite hemisphere):
• Very slow card movement
• Card may stick or bind
• Unusable for navigation
• May damage pivot from excessive friction

CRITICAL (>60° opposite hemisphere):
• Compass effectively non-functional
• Card may not move at all
• Serious navigation hazard
```

### Real-World Example
```
SCENARIO: UK Yacht Shipped to Australia

Vessel: 40ft cruiser from Southampton
Original Compass: Zone 2 (NH moderate balance)
New Location: Sydney, Australia (34°S, Zone 4)

SYMPTOMS REPORTED:
Week 1:  "Compass seems sluggish, thought it needed service"
Week 2:  "Compass very slow to respond, hard to steer"
Week 3:  "Compass barely working, switched to GPS"
Action:  Replaced with Zone 4 (SH) compass

LESSON: Don't ship boat without checking compass compatibility!
```

## Purchasing Guidance

### Buying New Compass

**Check BEFORE Purchase:**
1. Hemisphere/Zone marking
2. Intended latitude range
3. Your sailing area (now and future)
4. Price difference for global compass

**Questions to Ask Dealer:**
```
"Is this compass balanced for [your region]?"
"What zone is this compass?"
"Will this work in [latitude]?"
"Do you have southern hemisphere version?"
"What's the price for a global compass?"
```

### Used Compass Caution
```
⚠️ RISK: Used compass may be from different hemisphere

EXAMPLE:
• Buying used compass in US (could be NH)
• Planning to sail in Australia (need SH)
• Seller may not know/mention balance zone

ACTION:
• Check markings carefully
• Ask seller where boat was sailed
• Verify zone matches your needs
• Consider manufacturer lookup by serial number
```

### Budget Planning
```
Zone-Specific Compass:
  Budget:    £150-300
  Pros:      Accurate for specific region
  Cons:      Wrong if relocating/world cruise
  Best for:  Single-region sailing

Global/Universal Compass:
  Budget:    £400-800
  Pros:      Works anywhere, world cruising
  Cons:      Expensive, slightly less accurate
  Best for:  World cruising, hemisphere changes

Two Compasses (NH + SH):
  Budget:    £300-600 total
  Pros:      Most accurate in each hemisphere
  Cons:      Need to swap at equator
  Best for:  Circumnavigation, relocating boat
```

## Conversion/Replacement Checklist

### Relocating Vessel to Opposite Hemisphere
```
□ Check current compass zone marking
□ Determine new location zone requirement
□ Assess compatibility (use matrix above)
□ If incompatible:
  □ Source new compass (correct zone)
  □ Verify mounting compatibility
  □ Plan installation (may need electrical work)
  □ Budget for professional installation if needed
  □ Dispose of old compass properly
  □ Update vessel documentation
  □ Swing new compass for deviation
```

### Planning Equator Crossing
```
□ Identify compass hemisphere balance
□ Assess destination hemisphere requirements
□ Choose strategy:
  □ Option A: Install global compass before departure
  □ Option B: Carry replacement compass, swap mid-voyage
  □ Option C: Rely on GPS, replace at destination
□ Consider backup navigation (GPS, sextant)
□ Plan compass swap location if Option B
□ Budget accordingly
```

## Quick Decision Tree

```
START: Do I have the right compass?

1. Where do I sail NOW?
   ├─ Northern Hemisphere (>10°N) → Need NH compass (Zone 1-2)
   ├─ Southern Hemisphere (<10°S) → Need SH compass (Zone 4-5)
   └─ Equatorial (10°S-10°N) → Zone 3 or Universal

2. Will I cross equator?
   ├─ NO → Zone-specific compass fine
   └─ YES → Need Universal OR carry two compasses

3. World cruising?
   ├─ YES → Universal compass recommended
   └─ NO → Zone-specific compass cheaper

4. Check current compass marking:
   ├─ Matches current location → ✓ OK
   ├─ Opposite hemisphere → ✗ REPLACE
   ├─ Universal → ✓ OK anywhere
   └─ Unknown → Identify or replace

RESULT: [Compass recommendation]
