# SKILL: Auto-Routed Course Verification

## Description
Verify automatically-generated routes on a chart plotter by checking against paper charts and interpreting warning icons for hazards.

## Prerequisites
- Chart plotter operation (SKILL_51)
- Chart symbol recognition (SKILL_15)
- Hazard identification

## Learning Objectives
- Identify warning icons on auto-routed courses
- Explain why auto-routes must be checked on paper charts
- Interpret warning triangle symbols (shallows, rocks, overfalls)
- Zoom in on warnings to assess hazards electronically
- Modify unsafe auto-routed waypoints

## Key Concepts
**Auto-Route Function:**
- Automatically plots course between waypoints
- May not account for all hazards
- **Critical:** Must be verified on paper chart

**Warning Icons:**
- **Meaning:** Denote potential hazards along route
- **Types:**
  - Shallow water areas
  - Close proximity to rocks
  - Possible overfalls/tidal rips
  - Other navigation dangers

**Verification Process:**
1. Generate auto-route on plotter
2. Note all warning icons along route
3. Zoom in on each warning to inspect electronically
4. Plot same route on paper chart
5. Cross-check hazards against paper chart
6. Identify any hazards missed by auto-route
7. Reposition waypoints to avoid hazards
8. Re-verify modified route

**Electronic Inspection:**
- Zoom in on warning areas
- Check chart details at higher magnification
- Verify depth contours and obstructions
- Use vector chart query features if available

## Common Errors
- Trusting auto-route without verification
- Ignoring warning icons
- Not checking paper chart for complete picture
- Failing to zoom in and inspect warnings

## Assessment
- Identify 5 warning icons on sample auto-route
- Plot and verify auto-route on paper chart
- Explain why auto-route verification is mandatory
- Reposition waypoints to eliminate warnings
- Demonstrate electronic zoom inspection of hazards
