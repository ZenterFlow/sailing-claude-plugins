# SKILL: Leading Lights and Transits (SKILL_75)

## Description
Use leading lights and transits for precise navigation through hazards, maintaining course alignment, and checking compass deviation.

## Prerequisites
- Navigation Light Characteristics (SKILL_73)
- Light Ranges and Radar Beacons (SKILL_74)

## Learning Objectives
- Identify leading lines on charts and in almanacs
- Use leading lights for night pilotage
- Correct course deviations using transit alignment
- Construct improvised transits from charted objects
- Apply transit bearings for compass deviation checks

**Leading Lines:**
- **Definition:** Two objects in line indicating safe course through hazards
- **Chart Symbol:** Magenta line with direction arrow and true bearing
- **Day Use:** Prominent objects (cones, diamonds, spires) in transit
- **Night Use:** Leading lights (front and rear lights at different heights)

**Leading Lights Operation:**
- **Front Light:** Lower, closer to observer
- **Rear Light:** Higher, further away
- **Alignment:** When lights vertically aligned, you're on the transit line
- **Course Adjustment:** Steer toward the lower light to regain alignment

**Rule of Thumb:**
- **Entering:** Line bow with higher (rear) light
- **Leaving:** Line stern with higher (rear) light
- **Correction:** Lower light position indicates direction to turn
- **Lower light left of higher light:** Turn left to align
- **Lower light right of higher light:** Turn right to align

**Light Sequences:**
Leading lights have distinct sequences to differentiate them:
- **Rear:** Iso 4s (2 seconds light, 2 seconds dark)
- **Front:** Iso 2s (1 second light, 1 second dark)
- **Verification:** Always check light sequences match chart before relying on them

**Charted Transit Example:**
- **Magenta line** on chart with bearing 148°(T)
- **Day marks:** Cone down and diamond in transit
- **Night lights:** Iso 4s (rear) and Iso 2s (front)
- **Use:** Follow bearing keeping lights/objects aligned until safely in marina

**Improvised Transits:**
- **Creation:** Use any two prominent charted objects in suitable alignment
- **Advantage:** Custom navigation aid for specific destination
- **Verification:** Almanac may confirm known transits (e.g., "Chimney and Church spire at Seaview in transit (048°) lead into quay")

**Unspecified Transits:**
- Not charted but usable if objects prominent and suitably positioned
- Example: Use church spire and hilltop for local approach
- **Caution:** Not officially verified, use with care

**Compass Deviation Check:**
1. Sail across established transit on various courses
2. Sight down compass as transit is crossed
3. Difference between transit bearing and compass bearing = deviation (after removing variation)
4. Requires multiple headings to create deviation curve

**Pilotage Planning:**
- Draw small pilot plan showing depth contours along transit
- Add Height of Tide (HOT) to charted depths
- Use depth sounder to confirm position along transit line

## Common Errors
- Misidentifying front vs rear lights
- Turning wrong direction when off transit line
- Not verifying light sequences match chart
- Overcorrecting and overshooting transit alignment
- Forgetting rule reverses when leaving port vs entering

## Assessment
- Identify correct leading line bearing from chart
- Determine course correction from light misalignment
- Construct improvised transit from charted objects
- Use leading lights for night harbor entry
- Check compass deviation using transit
