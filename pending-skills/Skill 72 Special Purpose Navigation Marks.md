# SKILL: Special Purpose Navigation Marks (SKILL_72)

## Description
Identify and interpret isolated danger marks, safe water marks, special marks, and temporary wreck markers that provide specific hazard or boundary information beyond channel marking.

## Prerequisites
- IALA Buoyage System Fundamentals (SKILL_69)
- Cardinal Marks Navigation (SKILL_71)

## Learning Objectives
- Distinguish isolated danger from safe water marks
- Identify special marks and their uses
- Recognize temporary wreck marker characteristics
- Apply passage rules for each mark type
- Interpret unique light sequences for special marks

**Isolated Danger Mark:**
- **Purpose:** Marks isolated hazard with navigable water all around; no information on danger size
- **Appearance:** Black with red horizontal band(s)
- **Shape:** Pillar, spar, or buoy (any shape)
- **Topmark:** Two black balls (one above the other)
- **Light Color:** White
- **Light Sequence:** Fl(2)4s (2 white flashes within 4 seconds)
- **Rule:** Keep well clear, hazard directly below mark
- **Chart Symbol:** 

**Safe Water Mark / Fairway Buoy:**
- **Purpose:** Indicates safe open water, clear of hazards; marks estuary/marina entrance transition
- **Appearance:** Red and white vertical stripes (preferably spherical)
- **Shape:** Spherical or pillar
- **Topmark:** Single red sphere (if fitted)
- **Light Color:** White
- **Light Sequence Options:**
  - Occulting (more light than dark)
  - Isophase (equal light/dark periods)
  - Morse Code (A)
  - Long flash every 10 seconds (L Fl 10s)
- **Example:** Iso.4s (even 4-second light/dark cycle)
- **Rule:** Marks safe passage area, but do not become complacent

**Special Mark:**
- **Purpose:** Indicates special areas (pipelines, race courses, protected areas, commercial zones)
- **Appearance:** Yellow (single color)
- **Shape:** Any shape (usually appropriate for direction of buoyage)
- **Topmark:** Single yellow cross (X)
- **Light Color:** Yellow
- **Light Sequence:** Any sequence distinct from other marks
- **Example:** Fl(4)Y.10s (4 yellow flashes within 10 seconds)
- **Reference:** Check chart information box for specific purpose

**Temporary Wreck Marker:**
- **Purpose:** Marks recent wreck location (introduced relatively recently)
- **Appearance:** Blue and yellow vertical stripes
- **Shape:** Pillar or spar
- **Light Color:** Alternating blue and yellow
- **Rule:** Keep well clear, position may be approximate
- **Note:** Distinct from isolated danger mark (different colors)

**Key Distinctions:**
- **Isolated Danger:** Black/red bands, pass well clear
- **Safe Water:** Red/white vertical stripes, marks safe area
- **Special:** Yellow, indicates administrative/feature boundary
- **Wreck:** Blue/yellow stripes, recent hazard

## Common Errors
- Confusing isolated danger with safe water marks
- Forgetting special marks require chart reference for specific meaning
- Assuming safe water mark means hazard-free without consulting chart
- Mistaking wreck marker for special mark due to yellow color
- Not keeping extra clearance around isolated danger marks

## Assessment
- Identify mark type from appearance and light sequence
- Determine appropriate action for each mark type
- Interpret special mark purpose using chart information
- Navigate safely around isolated danger
- Distinguish between similar-appearing marks
