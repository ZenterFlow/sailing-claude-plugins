# SKILL: Cloud Types and Weather Forecasting (SKILL_88)

## Description
Identify cloud types, interpret their significance for weather forecasting, and predict approaching conditions based on cloud sequences.

## Prerequisites
- Weather System Interactions (SKILL_87)

## Learning Objectives
- Classify clouds by shape and altitude
- Interpret cloud indicators for atmospheric stability
- Recognize cloud sequences in frontal systems
- Identify cumulonimbus characteristics and hazards
- Predict visibility changes from cloud development

**Cloud Formation Basics**
- **Process:** Air lifts and cools until reaching dew point
- **Condensation:** Water vapor becomes visible as clouds
- **Significance:** Visual indication of vertical weather profile

**Cloud Shape Indicators**

**Flat (Stratus) Clouds:**
- **Indication:** Stable atmospheric conditions
- **Wind:** Gradual changes
- **Vertical Movement:** Limited
- **Associated With:** Warm fronts, settled conditions

**Vertical/Puffy (Cumulus) Clouds:**
- **Indication:** Unstable atmospheric conditions
- **Wind:** Gusty, squally conditions
- **Vertical Movement:** Significant
- **Associated With:** Cold fronts, convection, turbulence

**Classification System**
Combination of shape + altitude = cloud type

**Low Clouds (Surface to 2,000m / 6,500ft):**
- **Stratus (St):** Flat, layered, continuous sheet
- **Cumulus (Cu):** Puffy, individual heaps, fair weather
- **Nimbostratus (Ns):** Flat rain-bearing cloud (nimbus = rain)
- **Fractostratus:** Patchy, breaking up flat cloud (fracto = breaking)

**Medium Clouds (2,000-5,000m / 6,500-16,500ft):**
- **Altostratus (As):** Flat sheet at medium altitude
- **Altocumulus (Ac):** Puffy heaps at medium altitude
- **Characteristics:** Opaque, sun appears as through frosted glass

**High Clouds (Above 5,000m / 16,500ft):**
- **Cirrostratus (Cs):** Thin veil, halo around sun/moon
- **Cirrocumulus (Cc):** Small puffy ripples, "mackerel sky"
- **Cirrus (Ci):** Wispy, feathery, first sign of approaching system

**Cumulonimbus (Cb) - Special Category**
- **Height:** Multi-level, towers up to 12km (38,000ft)
- **Appearance:** 
  - Flat base often &lt;100m above sea
  - Dark wall-like feature underneath
  - Towering vertical development
- **Weather:** Classic thunderstorms
- **Hazards:** 
  - Strong turbulence
  - Heavy precipitation
  - Lightning
  - Squall lines with cold fronts
- **Timing:** Develops after cold front passage

**Frontal Cloud Sequences (NH Low Pressure)**

**Approaching Warm Front:**
1. **Cirrus (Ci):** High wispy clouds (first sign, 12-24 hrs out)
2. **Cirrostratus (Cs):** Thin veil, halo effect
3. **Altostratus (As):** Opaque sheet, sun blurred
4. **Nimbostratus (Ns):** Thick rain-bearing layer
5. **Precipitation:** Continuous rain begins
6. **Visibility:** Deteriorates to poor

**Warm Sector:**
- **Clouds:** Low stratus, possible fog
- **Conditions:** Drizzle, mist, poor visibility
- **Stability:** Relatively stable but moist

**Approaching Cold Front:**
- **Clouds:** Cumulus building vertically
- **Development:** Towering cumulonimbus
- **Conditions:** Squalls, thunderstorms

**Post-Cold Front:**
- **Clouds:** Scattered cumulus
- **Conditions:** Showers, good visibility between showers
- **Visibility:** Generally good except in showers

**Cloud Type Identification Guide**

| Cloud Name | Height | Shape | Precipitation | Visibility Impact |
|------------|--------|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Cirrus | High | Wispy/feathery | None | Good |
| Cirrostratus | High | Thin veil | None | Good (halo) |
| Altostratus | Medium | Flat sheet | Possible light | Moderate to poor |
| Nimbostratus | Low-medium | Thick flat | Continuous rain | Poor |
| Stratus | Low | Flat layer | Drizzle | Poor |
| Cumulus | Low | Puffy heaps | None (fair weather) | Good |
| Cumulonimbus | Multi-level | Towering vertical | Heavy/showers | Very poor to good between |
| Fractostratus | Any | Patchy fragments | Variable | Variable |

**Cloud Height Memory Aid:**
- **Cirro-:** High (above 5,000m)
- **Alto-:** Medium (2,000-5,000m)
- **No prefix:** Low (surface-2,000m)

**Weather Prediction Using Clouds**

**Stable Conditions (Stratus Dominant):**
- Gradual wind changes
- Steady precipitation (if any)
- Poor but steady visibility
- Warm frontal approach/passage

**Unstable Conditions (Cumulus Dominant):**
- Gusty, squally winds
- Showery precipitation
- Rapid visibility changes
- Cold frontal approach/passage
- Afternoon convection (sea breezes)

**Cumulonimbus Warning Signs:**
- **Vertical Development:** Cloud towers rapidly
- **Dark Base:** Very dark, wall-like appearance
- **Approach Time:** 30 minutes to few hours
- **Action:** Reef early, prepare for squalls before arrival

**Visibility Changes**

**Approaching Frontal System:**
- Cirrus → Cirrostratus: No visibility change
- Altostratus → Nimbostratus: Visibility deteriorates to poor
- Continuous rain: Poor visibility persists

**Cold Front Passage:**
- Pre-frontal cumulonimbus: Very poor visibility
- Post-frontal showers: Good visibility between showers

**Fog Formation (Different Cloud Type):**
- **Radiation Fog:** Land fog, formed by nighttime cooling
- **Advection Fog:** Sea fog, warm moist air over cold sea

## Common Errors
- Confusing altostratus with cirrostratus altitude
- Missing cumulonimbus development until too late
- Not recognizing cirrus as first warning sign
- Forgetting nimbostratus indicates continuous rain
- Misidentifying fracto- clouds as new types

## Assessment
- Identify cloud type from description or image
- Predict weather sequence from observed clouds
- Determine atmospheric stability from cloud shapes
- Recognize cumulonimbus hazards and timing
- Forecast visibility changes from cloud progression
