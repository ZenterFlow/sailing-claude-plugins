# Magnetic Variation Directional Rules

## Quick Reference

| Base Variation | Annual Movement | Action | Memory Aid |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|------------|
| West (W) | East (E) | **SUBTRACT** | East eating into West |
| West (W) | West (W) | **ADD** | West getting bigger |
| East (E) | East (E) | **ADD** | East getting bigger |
| East (E) | West (W) | **SUBTRACT** | West eating into East |

## The Simple Rule
> **Moving East makes the variation number smaller (toward 0°)**
>
> **Moving West makes the variation number larger (away from 0°)**

---

## Examples

### Example 1: 7° W with 8' E movement
```
West variation, moving East → SUBTRACT
7° W - 8' = 6° 52' W
(Getting closer to 0° - the variation is decreasing)
```

### Example 2: 2° E with 5' E movement
```
East variation, moving East → ADD
2° E + 5' = 2° 05' E
(Getting further from 0° - the variation is increasing)
```

### Example 3: 5° W with 3' W movement
```
West variation, moving West → ADD
5° W + 3' = 5° 03' W
(Getting further from 0° - the variation is increasing)
```

### Example 4: 4° E with 6' W movement
```
East variation, moving West → SUBTRACT
4° E - 6' = 3° 54' E
(Getting closer to 0° - the variation is decreasing)
```

## Critical Notes

1. **The agonic line is moving westward** in most of the Northern Hemisphere
2. **UK/Europe**: Generally West variation moving East (decreasing)
3. **East Coast USA**: Generally West variation moving West (increasing)
4. **West Coast USA**: Generally East variation moving East (increasing)
5. **Near magnetic poles**: Large variations (30°+) and faster change rates

## Common Exam Question Pattern
> "Variation was 6° 20' W in 2008, annual change 10' E. What is it in 2024?"
>
> Answer: 6° 20' W - (10' × 16 years) = 6° 20' W - 2° 40' = 3° 40' W ≈ **4° W**
