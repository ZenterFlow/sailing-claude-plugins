## Purpose

Master the core concept of pilotage using visible references to avoid invisible hazards, and identify critical information sources for safe harbor navigation.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you ask about:
- Pilotage fundamentals or concept
- Almanac and pilot book information
- Why not to rely on GPS alone
- Cockpit navigation practices
- Information sources for harbor entry

## Behavior

### Core Concept

**Pilotage Definition**: Using visible objects to avoid invisible dangers

The fundamental principle is maintaining situational awareness through direct observation rather than relying solely on electronic systems.

### Essential Information Sources

**Almanac Contents:**
- Entry waypoints and harbor approaches
- Local hazards and obstruction details
- Visual depth information and sounding data
- Small boat channels and traffic lanes
- Charted transits and leading lines
- Mooring locations and types
- Port traffic regulations and VHF channels
- Local buoyage movements and patterns
- Detailed port and marina plans

**Chart Information:**
- Depth contours for safe corridors
- Charted transits (magenta lines with true bearings)
- Buoyage positions and characteristics
- Visual landmarks and prominent objects
- Tidal stream data

### Why Not Rely on Chartplotter Alone

**Position Fix vs Situational Awareness**:
- GNSS shows where you are but NOT what is around you
- Electronic systems give position, not hazard awareness

**Visual Verification**:
- Depth gauge confirms position
- Visual features provide continuous feedback
- Real-world observation catches errors immediately

**Cockpit Presence**:
- Navigator MUST be on deck to monitor crew and surroundings
- Below-deck navigation creates dangerous detachment from real environment
- Crew safety requires skipper's physical presence and oversight

**False Security**:
- Chartplotter creates illusion of complete information
- Electronic failure leaves navigator unprepared
- Situational awareness cannot be gained from screen

**Best Practice**: Use GNSS as one tool among many, NOT as primary pilotage method

### Information Gathering Strategy

**Almanac Coverage**:
- Not all sailing areas have dedicated almanacs
- Coverage varies by region
- Popular areas well-documented

**Local Publications**:
- Use when almanac unavailable
- Often more detailed for specific regions
- Cruising guides and pilot books supplement official sources

**Multiple Sources**:
- Combine charts, almanac, pilot books, cruising guides
- Cross-reference information for accuracy
- Look for recent updates and corrections

**Local Knowledge**:
- Supplement published information with harbor master advice
- Ask experienced local sailors
- Monitor VHF for real-time information

### Variation Application for Pilotage

**Charted Bearings**:
- Typically shown in TRUE
- Magenta transit lines use true bearings
- Chart symbols and range lines are true

**Hand Bearing Compass**:
- Reads MAGNETIC only
- No electronic compensation
- Direct magnetic reading from compass

**Conversion Rule**:
- Always apply variation to use plotted bearings with hand compass
- TRUE to MAGNETIC: Apply CADET rule
- **Example**: If variation is 6°W, magnetic bearing = true bearing - 6°

**Formula**:
```
Magnetic = True - Variation West
Magnetic = True + Variation East
```

### Proper Navigation Station

**During Pilotage**:
- Navigator's place is in COCKPIT
- Not below at chart table
- Direct visual observation essential
- Immediate response capability required

**Planning Location**:
- Chart table for pre-planning
- Create pilotage plan in advance
- Take simplified plan to cockpit

**Execution Location**:
- Cockpit with pilotage plan
- Hand bearing compass ready
- Depth sounder visible
- Crew positioned for immediate action

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Attempting pilotage from below deck using only chartplotter
❌ Neglecting to consult almanac for port-specific regulations
❌ Forgetting to convert true bearings to magnetic for hand compass use
❌ Relying on inexperienced crew to monitor position while skipper is below
❌ Failing to research areas not covered by standard almanacs
❌ Assuming GPS accuracy means complete safety
❌ Not maintaining visual lookout during electronic navigation

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- List minimum five information categories from almanac for harbor entry
- Explain why visual observation is superior to GNSS for close-quarters navigation
- Convert true bearing to magnetic given variation
- Identify information gaps for uncharted areas
- Evaluate proper navigation station location during pilotage
- Describe complete information gathering process

### Practical Application

**Scenario**: Planning harbor entry to unknown port

1. **Research**:
   - Check almanac for port information (waypoints, hazards, channels, moorings, regulations)
   - Study chart for depth contours, transits, buoyage, landmarks
   - Note tidal information and streams
   - Identify VHF channels for port control

2. **Planning**:
   - Convert all transit bearings from true to magnetic
   - Create simplified cockpit-friendly pilotage plan
   - Identify visual confirmation points
   - Plan contingencies for poor visibility

3. **Execution**:
   - Navigate from cockpit with plan and hand bearing compass
   - Use GPS for position verification, not primary navigation
   - Monitor depth continuously
   - Maintain visual awareness of surroundings
   - Respond immediately to observed hazards

**Scenario**: Variation 6°W, charted transit 048°T

1. **Conversion**: Magnetic = 048° - 6° = 042°M
2. **Hand Bearing Compass**: Watch for objects in transit at 042°M
3. **Visual Check**: Confirm alignment by eye
4. **Depth Verification**: Monitor expected depth along transit
