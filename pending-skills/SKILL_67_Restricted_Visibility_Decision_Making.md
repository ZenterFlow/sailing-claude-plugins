# SKILL: Restricted Visibility Navigation Decision-Making

## Description
Evaluate factors when deciding whether to continue navigation into port or stand off and wait for conditions to improve in fog or restricted visibility.

## Prerequisites
- All electronic navigation skills (48-65)
- Passage planning (62)
- Radar pilotage (60)

## Learning Objectives
- Identify factors for continue vs stand-off decision
- Assess equipment capabilities and limitations
- Evaluate harbor entrance complexity and hazards
- Consider traffic density and other vessel risks
- Make safe decision based on comprehensive assessment

**Decision Framework:**
**Continue Navigation IF:**
- **Equipment:** Radar working well, plotter verified, depth sounder reliable
- **Harbor:** Simple entrance, no complex obstacles, good radar targets
- **Traffic:** Low density, minimal collision risk
- **Visibility:** Some visibility (&gt;0.25 mile), improving trend
- **Crew:** Experienced, rested, proficient with radar
- **Plan:** Safe route identified, contingencies prepared
- **Depth:** Adequate water throughout, good margin

**Stand Off / Wait IF:**
- **Equipment:** Radar questionable, plotter not verified
- **Harbor:** Complex entrance, narrow channel, poor radar targets
- **Traffic:** High density, multiple vessels navigating
- **Visibility:** Very poor (&lt;0.25 mile), deteriorating
- **Crew:** Fatigued, inexperienced with radar
- **Hazards:** Unidentified obstacles, moving hazards
- **Uncertainty:** Any doubt about safe passage

**Key Assessment Factors:**
1. **Radar capability:** Can you identify entrance and hazards?
2. **Chart plotter accuracy:** Verified with radar overlay?
3. **Depth safety:** Is there a safe depth contour to follow?
4. **Traffic situation:** AIS/radar shows other vessels moving?
5. **Entrance complexity:** Simple vs difficult approach?
6. **Alternative options:** Safe anchorage available outside?
7. **Crew readiness:** Proficient with equipment and procedures?
8. **Visibility trend:** Improving or getting worse?
9. **Time pressure:** Is waiting until conditions improve an option?

**Stand-Off Strategy:**
- **Find safe anchorage:** Outside channel, clear of traffic
- **Monitor conditions:** Visibility, weather forecasts
- **Maintain watch:** Listen for other vessels, monitor VHF
- **Plan re-entry:** When conditions improve or daylight
- **Consider alternatives:** Different port, wait for tug escort

**Common Sense Approach:**
- **If in doubt, don't:** Most important rule
- **Better to wait:** Than risk accident
- **No shame in standing off:** Sign of good seamanship
- **Pressure:** Don't let schedule override safety

## Common Errors
- Pressuring self to continue due to schedule
- Underestimating difficulty of harbor entrance
- Over-reliance on equipment without verification
- Ignoring visibility trends
- Not identifying safe stand-off location in advance

## Assessment
- Evaluate scenario and recommend continue/stand off
- Identify 8 factors in decision-making process
- Assess harbor entrance difficulty from chart
- Determine safe stand-off position
- Explain decision to examiner with justification
