# SKILL: Day Shapes and Vessel Identification (SKILL_94)

## Description
Identify vessel types and operational status from day shapes, interpret combined light/shape displays, and apply correct identification for collision avoidance.

## Prerequisites
- Navigation Lights and Sound Signals (SKILL_93)

## Learning Objectives
- Recognize all standard day shapes and their meanings
- Identify vessel status from combined lights and shapes
- Distinguish fishing vessel types by day shapes
- Apply underwater operations obstruction markings
- Identify vessel distress signals

**Day Shapes Display Requirements**
Day shapes must be displayed:
- **Daytime Hours:** Between sunrise and sunset
- **Restricted Visibility:** When in or near areas of restricted visibility during daylight

**Standard Day Shapes Reference**

**Vessel at Anchor (Rule 30):**
- **Shape:** Black ball where best seen
- **Combination:** Displayed with anchor lights at night

**Vessel Aground (Rule 30):**
- **Shape:** Three black balls in vertical line
- **Night Addition:** Anchor lights plus two vertical red lights

**Not Under Command (NUC) (Rule 27):**
- **Shape:** Two black balls in vertical line
- **Night Lights:** Two vertical red all-round lights
- **Meaning:** Severely restricted in ability to deviate from course

**Restricted in Ability to Manoeuvre (RAM) (Rule 27):**
- **Shape:** Ball-diamond-ball in vertical line
- **Night Lights:** Red-white-red vertical all-round lights
- **Examples:** Underwater operations, dredging, cable laying, maintaining navigation aids

**Vessel Engaged in Underwater Operations (Rule 27):**
- **RAM Shapes:** Ball-diamond-ball vertical
- **Obstruction Marks:** 
  - **Obstruction Side:** Two black balls vertical (or two red lights at night)
  - **Clear Side:** Two diamonds vertical (or two green lights at night)
- **Passing Instruction:** Pass on diamond/green side (clear side)

**Vessel Engaged in Fishing (Rule 26):**
- **Other Fishing (not trawling):** Two cones with apexes together, one above the other
- **Trawling:** Same cone shape, plus additional requirements
- **Gear Warning:** If gear extends &gt;150m, cone apex upward in direction of gear

**Vessel Engaged in Trawling (Rule 26):**
- **Same Shape:** Two cones with apexes together
- **Additional:** Masthead light abaft and higher than all-round green light
- **Day Differentiation:** Requires careful observation of other characteristics

**Vessel Constrained by Draught (CBD) (Rule 28):**
- **Shape:** Cylinder (day shape only - no distinctive night shape)
- **Night Lights:** Three vertical red lights
- **Meaning:** Restricted to narrow channel by draft

**Vessel Towing (Rule 24):**
- **Length ≤200m:** RAM shapes (ball-diamond-ball)
- **Length &gt;200m:** Additional diamond shape(s) to indicate length

**Minesweeper (Rule 27):**
- **Shape:** Three balls in triangle shape
- **Night Lights:** Three green lights in triangle shape
- **Meaning:** Engaged in minesweeping operations

**Diver Down Warning (Rule 27):**
- **Flag:** International Code Flag A (white and blue swallow-tailed)
- **Meaning:** Diver down, keep well clear and slow down
- **Night:** Appropriate lights for vessel type plus Morse A signal

**Vessel in Distress:**
- **Shape:** Basket shape (historical, rarely seen)
- **Modern:** Use of distress signals (flares, flags, radio)
- **Flag:** Square flag with ball above or below (day distress signal)

**Motor Sailing Day Shape (Rule 25):**
- **Shape:** Cone apex pointing downward
- **Meaning:** Vessel is motor sailing (sailing vessel under power)
- **Size:** Proportionate to vessel size (clearly visible)

**Combined Display Interpretation**

**Vessel Underway and Making Way:**
Only four types show making way by lights alone:
1. **RAM:** Aspect lights + type lights = making way
2. **NUC:** Aspect lights + type lights = making way
3. **Fishing (other):** Aspect lights + red/white type lights = making way
4. **Trawling:** Aspect lights + green/white type lights = making way

**All Other Vessels:**
- **Underway:** Type lights only (no aspect lights)
- **Making Way:** No distinction in light display (must infer from context)
- **Example:** Power vessel shows same lights whether making way or drifting

**Fishing Vessel Specifics**

**Other Fishing (Red over White):**
- **Day:** Two cones apex together
- **Night:** Red over white all-round vertical lights
- **Gear &gt;150m:** Additional white light or cone apex in gear direction

**Trawling (Green over White):**
- **Day:** Two cones apex together (same as other fishing)
- **Night:** Green over white vertical, plus masthead light abaft
- **Masthead Light:** Positioned higher and abaft of green light

**Key Differentiation:**
- **Light Color:** Red vs Green top light
- **Masthead Light:** Present on trawlers, absent on other fishing
- **Status:** Both RAM when gear restricts maneuverability

**Vessel Distress Signals**

**Day Signals:**
- **Flag:** Square flag with ball above or below
- **Shapes:** Basket shape (historical)
- **Morse:** SOS by light/flag
- **Drums:** Continuous sounding

**Night Signals:**
- **Flares:** Red parachute flares, red hand flares
- **Lights:** SOS Morse, continuous red light
- **Flames:** Bucket of burning oil (traditional)

**IRPCS Rules in Action - Identification Exercise**

**Scenario Analysis Approach:**
1. **Observe Lights:** Type lights, aspect lights, configuration
2. **Check Shapes:** Any day shapes displayed
3. **Determine Status:** Underway, making way, anchored, aground
4. **Identify Type:** Power, sail, fishing, RAM, NUC, CBD
5. **Assess Length:** From light characteristics (if possible)
6. **Determine Aspect:** Port, starboard, head-on, stern
7. **Apply Hierarchy:** Who gives way based on vessel type

**Vessel Length Indicators from Lights:**

**Power Vessels:**
- **One Masthead Light:** Probably under 50m (or between 12-50m)
- **Two Masthead Lights:** Probably over 50m
- **Visibility Ranges:** 2nm (small), 3nm (medium), 5-6nm (large)

**Sailing Vessels:**
- **Tricolour:** Under 20m
- **Red Over Green:** Under 20m (optional addition)

**Fishing Vessels:**
- **Trawler &lt;50m:** Not required to show masthead light (but may)
- **Trawler ≥50m:** Required masthead light

**Special Cases:**

**Vessel &lt;20m Sailing - Tricolour Use:**
- **Advantage:** Economical (one light instead of three)
- **Restriction:** Use ONLY when sailing (not motoring)
- **Prevention:** Prevents confusion with power vessel lights

**Vessel Motor Sailing - Cone Display:**
- **Day:** Cone apex down (visible to other vessels)
- **Night:** Steaming + sidelights + stern (tricolour OFF)
- **Fog:** Power vessel signal (1 long blast)

**Diver Down - Flag A:**
- **Requirement:** Rigid replica of International Code Flag A
- **Color:** White and blue swallow-tailed
- **Action:** Keep well clear and slow down

## Common Errors
- Confusing fishing vessel types (red vs green top light)
- Forgetting towing vessels display RAM shapes plus towing lights
- Misidentifying vessel length from incomplete light display
- Not recognizing underwater operations obstruction markings
- Missing motor sailing cone during daytime
- Failing to display day shapes when required

## Assessment
- Identify vessel type from combined light/shape display
- Determine if vessel is underway or making way from lights
- Distinguish trawling from other fishing by light configuration
- Identify safe passing side for underwater operations
- Recognize vessel distress signals day and night
- Apply correct identification to collision avoidance decision
