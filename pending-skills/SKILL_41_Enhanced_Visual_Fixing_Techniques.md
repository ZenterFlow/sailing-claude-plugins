# SKILL: Enhanced Visual Fixing Techniques

## Description
Apply advanced visual fixing methods including pre-plotted webs, running fixes, and multi-object fixes to achieve reliable position determination.

## Prerequisites
- Position line plotting
- Running fix (SKILL_35)
- Navigation web (SKILL_37)

## Learning Objectives
- Plot and use pre-constructed navigation webs
- Execute running fix with single object
- Plot three-point fix for maximum accuracy
- Select objects based on bearing spread and distance
- Combine visual fixes with depth/sounder data

## Technique Integration
**Three-Point Fix (Optimal):**
1. Select 3 charted objects with wide bearing separation (120° ideal)
2. Take bearings sequentially (&lt;2 minutes between)
3. Convert to True and plot from objects seaward
4. Intersection triangle = position (center of triangle)
5. Most reliable fix when objects are well-distributed

**Running Fix (When limited objects):**
- Use SKILL_35 method
- Requires steady course and time interval
- Less accurate than three-point fix but valuable with limited visibility

**Navigation Web Application:**
- Pre-plot bearings and distances to destination
- Use GPS bearing/distance for instant position
- Monitor progress toward hazards
- Make tacking decisions without plotting

**Object Selection Strategy:**
- **Primary:** Lighthouse, beacon (precise, charted)
- **Secondary:** Headland, point, stack
- **Tertiary:** Summit, building (less precise)
- **Avoid:** Vague coastline, uncharted features

**Fix Enhancement:**
- Add depth contour crossing as position line
- Use radar ranges to confirm distances
- Combine GPS position as verification
- Record log, time, depth for each fix

## Common Errors
- Taking too long between bearings (significant tide movement)
- Using objects with poor charted positions
- Not labeling fix with time and log
- Forgetting to convert bearings to True

## Assessment
- Plot three-point fix with &lt;0.2 NM error
- Execute running fix from given data
- Use navigation web to determine position in &lt;30 seconds
- Evaluate fix quality and suggest improvements
