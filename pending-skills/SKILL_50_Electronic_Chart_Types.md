# SKILL: Electronic Chart Types (RNC vs ENC)

## Description
Distinguish between Raster Navigational Charts (RNC) and Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC), understand their limitations, and interpret quality indicators.

## Prerequisites
- Paper chart familiarity

## Learning Objectives
- Define RNC and ENC construction methods
- Identify advantages/disadvantages of each chart type
- Interpret zoom behavior differences
- Locate and interpret quality of data indicators
- Understand why RNC charts carry paper chart errors

## Chart Type Comparison
**RNC (Raster Navigational Chart):**
- Scanned bitmap image of paper chart
- Identical symbols/colors as paper chart
- **Advantage:** Familiar appearance, cost-effective
- **Disadvantage:** Cannot query data, zoom distorts image (pixelation)
- Carries inherent paper chart errors
- Not suitable for ECDIS (commercial systems)

**ENC (Electronic Navigational Chart):**
- Vector database constructed from lines/points/areas
- Includes associated database with multiple information layers
- **Advantage:** Query objects for details, zoom without distortion, alarms for hazards
- **Disadvantage:** May not match paper chart appearance
- Required for official ECDIS systems

**Zoom Behavior:**
- **RNC:** Larger pixels, blurs when zoomed in
- **ENC:** Scales cleanly, shows more detail as zoomed in

**Quality Indicators:**
- **Paper charts:** Source data diagram shows survey year/method
  - Example: "Lead line 1918" = old/unreliable data
- **ENC/ECDIS:** Star rating system for data quality
  - More stars = better quality, more recent survey
- **Recreational plotters:** No standard representation - check manual

## Common Errors
- Assuming zoomed RNC provides more detail
- Not checking data quality before navigating
- Thinking all chart areas are equally reliable
- Using recreational ENC as primary source

## Assessment
- Identify chart type from screenshot (RNC vs ENC)
- Interpret source data diagram and assess reliability
- Explain why ENC is better for hazard alarms
- Demonstrate zoom behavior difference
- Check data quality on sample chart area
