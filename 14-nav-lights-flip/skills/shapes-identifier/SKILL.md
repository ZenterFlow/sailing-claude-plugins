# Day Shapes Identifier

## Purpose
Interactive quiz and identification tool for COLREGS day shapes (Rules 20-31). Teaches recognition of black shapes displayed by vessels during daylight to indicate special status or operations. Critical for Yachtmaster Offshore practical and theory exams.

## Activation Triggers
This skill activates when users request:
- Day shapes identification or quizzes
- Questions about vessel shapes during daylight
- Exam preparation for COLREGS day signals
- Vessel status identification by shape

## Behavior

### Quiz Format
Present vessel scenarios or shape descriptions and ask user to identify meaning, or describe vessel situation and ask for correct shape. Use multiple-choice format emphasizing common exam mistakes.

### Complete Day Shapes Reference

**Shape Specifications:**
- All shapes must be **black**
- Minimum diameter/height: **0.6m** (2 feet)
- Displayed **"where they can best be seen"** (typically forward)
- Required during **daylight hours** when visibility permits

### Day Shapes by Vessel Status

**Ball (Single Sphere):**
- **Meaning**: Vessel at anchor
- **Position**: Forward, where best seen
- **Size**: Not less than 0.6m diameter
- **Note**: Vessels <7m not required to show ball in designated anchorage

**Two Balls in Vertical Line:**
- **Meaning**: Not Under Command (NUC)
- **Position**: Where best seen
- **Spacing**: Clear vertical separation
- **Common Mistake**: Confusing with RAM (which uses ball-diamond-ball)

**Ball-Diamond-Ball in Vertical Line:**
- **Meaning**: Restricted in Ability to Maneuver (RAM)
- **Position**: Where best seen
- **Spacing**: Ball at top, diamond middle, ball at bottom
- **Examples**: Vessel engaged in dredging, diving, minesweeping, cable-laying, replenishment, launching aircraft

**Cone (Apex Down):**
- **Meaning**: Sailing vessel under power (motor-sailing)
- **Position**: Forward, where best seen
- **Apex Direction**: Pointing DOWN (critical detail)
- **Key Point**: Must show whenever engine is running, even if still under sail

**Two Cones, Apexes Together (Hourglass/Bowtie):**
- **Meaning**: Vessel engaged in trawling
- **Position**: Where best seen
- **Apex Direction**: Points touching in middle
- **Distinction**: Trawling = nets towed through water

**Two Cones, Apexes Apart (Double Cone):**
- **Meaning**: Vessel engaged in fishing (other than trawling)
- **Position**: Where best seen
- **Apex Direction**: Bases facing each other, points outward
- **Examples**: Longline fishing, drift nets, stationary gear

**Cylinder:**
- **Meaning**: Vessel Constrained by Draft (CBD)
- **Position**: Where best seen
- **Only applies**: When vessel is UNDERWAY
- **Key Distinction**: NOT shown at anchor
- **Common Mistake**: Confusing with RAM shapes

**Diamond:**
- **Meaning**: Vessel engaged in towing or being towed
- **Position**: Where best seen on towing vessel
- **Note**: If tow >200m, diamond shape is MANDATORY
- **On towed vessel**: May show diamond where best seen

**Three Balls in Vertical Line:**
- **Meaning**: Vessel aground
- **Position**: Where best seen
- **Spacing**: Clear vertical separation
- **Also shows**: Anchor ball if required by size

### Special Cases - Exam Favorites

**Basket (Inverted Cone/Wide Top):**
- **Meaning**: Pilot vessel (historical)
- **Modern Practice**: Now "H" flag more common
- **Exam Note**: Still valid under COLREGS

**Minesweeping Operations:**
- **Shapes**: Ball-diamond-ball + **three balls on horizontal line**
- **Meaning**: RAM engaged in minesweeping + keep clear indicator
- **Exam Critical**: Three balls horizontal = minesweeping specific

**Diving Operations:**
- **Shapes**: Ball-diamond-ball
- **Flag**: Code flag "A" (Alpha) - white and blue swallow-tail
- **Meaning**: RAM with divers down
- **Keep Clear**: Vessels must stay 100m clear

### Quiz Examples

**Example Question 1:**
*"You see a sailing yacht displaying a black cone with the apex pointing down. What does this indicate?"*

A) Vessel not under command
B) Vessel restricted in ability to maneuver
C) Sailing vessel using engine (motor-sailing)
D) Vessel engaged in fishing

**Answer**: C - Motor-sailing (cone apex down = engine running)

**Example Question 2:**
*"A vessel shows three black balls in a vertical line. What is this vessel's status?"*

A) At anchor (over 50m length)
B) Aground
C) Not under command making way
D) Minesweeping operations

**Answer**: B - Aground (three balls vertical = aground, one ball = anchor)

**Example Question 3:**
*"What shape(s) must a vessel engaged in trawling display during daylight?"*

A) Two cones, apexes together
B) Two cones, apexes apart
C) Ball-diamond-ball
D) Diamond only

**Answer**: A - Two cones, apexes together (hourglass/bowtie shape)

**Example Question 4:**
*"A dredger working in a channel displays which shapes?"*

A) Diamond
B) Ball-diamond-ball
C) Two cones apexes together
D) Cylinder

**Answer**: B - Ball-diamond-ball (dredging = RAM operation)

### Common Exam Mistakes to Test

1. **Cone Apex Direction**: Apex down (not up) for motor-sailing
2. **Aground vs Anchor**: Three balls (aground) vs one ball (anchor)
3. **Trawling vs Other Fishing**: Apexes together (trawling) vs apart (other fishing)
4. **CBD Cylinder**: Only when UNDERWAY, not at anchor
5. **NUC vs RAM**: Two balls (NUC) vs ball-diamond-ball (RAM)
6. **Minesweeping**: Ball-diamond-ball PLUS three balls horizontal
7. **Shape Size**: Minimum 0.6m diameter (exam specification)

### Memory Aids

- **"Apex Down, Engine's On"** (motor-sailing cone)
- **"Hourglass Shape, Trawling Scrape"** (trawling = apexes together)
- **"Points Apart, Fishing Art"** (other fishing = apexes apart)
- **"Cylinder Tube, Deep Draft Dude"** (CBD)
- **"Three in a Row, Aground You Know"** (aground = three balls vertical)
- **"RAM's Got Diamonds"** (RAM = ball-diamond-ball)

### Visual Description Format

When presenting shapes in quiz, use clear text descriptions:
- **Ball**: ⚫ (solid circle)
- **Cone apex down**: 🔻 (point down)
- **Cone apex up**: 🔺 (point up)
- **Diamond**: 🔶 (diamond shape)
- **Cylinder**: ⬛ (vertical rectangle)

### Quiz Flow

1. **Present Scenario**: Describe vessel situation or show shape configuration
2. **Multiple Choice**: Offer 4 options including common mistakes
3. **Accept Answer**: User selects A/B/C/D
4. **Provide Feedback**: Correct answer + explanation + memory aid
5. **Track Progress**: Running score and weak areas
6. **Continue**: Next question or summary

### Difficulty Levels

**Basic:**
- Single ball (anchor)
- Cone apex down (motor-sailing)
- Three balls vertical (aground)

**Intermediate:**
- Two balls (NUC)
- Ball-diamond-ball (RAM)
- Trawling vs other fishing

**Advanced:**
- Cylinder (CBD) vs RAM shapes
- Minesweeping special shapes
- Combined scenarios (e.g., RAM at anchor shows both anchor ball AND RAM shapes)

### Shape Combination Scenarios

**RAM at Anchor:**
- Shows: Anchor ball (forward) + Ball-diamond-ball (where best seen)
- Common mistake: Thinking only one set of shapes required

**Towing Over 200m:**
- Shows: Diamond shape (mandatory)
- Day + Night: Diamond shape AND lights required

**Motor-Sailing Under 7m:**
- May be exempt from showing cone if <12m in some jurisdictions
- Exam answer: Cone apex down still technically correct

### Exam Simulation Mode

8-question rapid-fire quiz:
- 2 anchor/aground questions
- 2 fishing vessel questions
- 2 NUC/RAM/CBD questions
- 1 motor-sailing question
- 1 special case (minesweeping, diving, towing)
