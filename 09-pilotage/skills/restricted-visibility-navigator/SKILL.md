# SKILL: restricted-visibility-navigator
**RYA Yachtmaster – Restricted Visibility Navigation**

## Purpose
Provide safe navigation procedures for restricted visibility (fog, heavy rain, snow). Covers COLREGS sound signals, navigation techniques, equipment usage, and safety protocols for visibility <2nm.

## Activation Triggers
- "restricted visibility"
- "fog navigation"
- "poor visibility"
- "fog signals"
- "sound signals"
- "fog procedures"

## Behaviour
1. **Define visibility status**:
   - Good: >5nm
   - Moderate: 2-5nm
   - Restricted: <2nm (COLREGS Rule 19 applies)
   - Poor: <1nm
   - Very poor: <0.5nm

2. **Sound signal requirements** (COLREGS Rule 35):

   **Power vessel underway** (making way):
   - 1 prolonged blast every 2 minutes

   **Power vessel underway** (stopped, not making way):
   - 2 prolonged blasts every 2 minutes

   **Sailing vessel**:
   - 1 prolonged + 2 short every 2 minutes

   **At anchor**:
   - Rapid bell ringing for 5 seconds every minute
   - (Vessel >100m: bell forward, gong aft)

3. **Navigation procedures**:
   - Reduce speed to safe speed for conditions
   - Post lookouts (visual and audible)
   - Sound signals as required
   - Radar if available (guard mode, CPA/TCPA alarms)
   - GPS/chartplotter for position
   - Frequent position fixes
   - Consider heaving-to or anchoring

4. **Safety actions**:
   - All crew on deck, lifejackets
   - Navigation lights on
   - Radar reflector hoisted
   - VHF on (listen for traffic)
   - Prepare anchor for immediate use
   - Brief crew on fog procedures

## Example Output
```
RESTRICTED VISIBILITY PROCEDURES
═══════════════════════════════════════

CURRENT CONDITIONS: Visibility 0.3nm (poor)
STATUS: COLREGS Rule 19 applies

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────
1. ⚠️ Reduce speed to safe speed (suggest 3-4 knots)
2. 🔊 Sound signals: 1 long + 2 short every 2 min (sailing vessel)
3. 👀 Post dedicated lookout forward
4. 🔦 Navigation lights ON
5. 📻 VHF Ch 16 monitor (+ local traffic channel)
6. 📍 Plot position every 10 minutes

EQUIPMENT CHECKS:
─────────────────────────────────────
✓ Radar: ON, guard zone set, 3nm range
✓ GPS: Position updating, track history ON
✓ Depth sounder: ALARM set for shallow water
✓ AIS: ON (if available)
✓ Radar reflector: HOISTED

SOUND SIGNALS (Sailing Vessel):
─────────────────────────────────────
• = Prolonged (4-6 seconds)
- = Short (~1 second)

Your signal: • - - (every 2 minutes)
[Long, short, short]

Set timer/alarm for 2-minute intervals

OTHER VESSELS' SIGNALS:
─────────────────────────────────────
• (every 2 min) = Power vessel making way
• • (every 2 min) = Power vessel stopped
• - (every 2 min) = Towing
• - - - (every 2 min) = Pilot vessel
• - • (every 2 min) = Fishing/trawling
Bell (every 1 min) = Vessel at anchor

NAVIGATION STRATEGY:
─────────────────────────────────────
→ Continue if visibility >0.5nm and clear radar
→ Heave-to if visibility <0.5nm or traffic dense
→ Anchor if in suitable depth and clear of traffic
→ Navigate by GPS/chart plotter + depth sounder
→ Avoid traffic lanes and busy channels

ABORT CRITERIA:
─────────────────────────────────────
⛔ Visibility <0.3nm
⛔ Multiple radar contacts close range
⛔ In or near TSS without radar
⛔ Crew unable to maintain watch
⛔ Equipment failure (GPS, depth, radar)

→ If abort: Heave-to or anchor in safe depth

CREW BRIEFING:
─────────────────────────────────────
• All hands on deck with lifejackets
• Dedicated lookout forward (listen for fog signals)
• Helmsman concentrates on steering
• Navigator monitors position/radar/traffic
• Report ANY sound, light, or radar contact immediately
• Prepare to alter course/stop/sound fog horn

⚠️ REMEMBER: In restricted visibility, even correct actions can lead to collision. Stay alert, go slow, be ready to stop.
```

## Teaching Notes
- Rule 19 (restricted visibility) overrides Rules 11-18 (conduct in sight)
- "Safe speed" means able to stop in time to avoid collision
- Sound signals are LEGAL REQUIREMENT, not optional
- Lookout must listen as well as look
- If in doubt, slow down or stop
