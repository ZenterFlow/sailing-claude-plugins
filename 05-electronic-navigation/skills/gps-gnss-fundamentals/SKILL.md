**RYA Yachtmaster – GPS/GNSS Fundamentals and Accuracy**

## Purpose
Understand GPS/GNSS positioning principles, interpret accuracy metrics (HDOP), and identify factors affecting fix quality.

## Activation Triggers
- "how does GPS work"
- "what is HDOP"
- "GPS accuracy"
- "satellite navigation basics"

## Behaviour
Core Concepts:
- **Satellite Constellation**: 24+ satellites, 4 required for 3D fix (lat/long/altitude)
- **Multiple Systems**: GPS (US), Galileo (EU), Glonass (RU), Beidou (CN)
- **95% Accuracy**: Within 15 meters under good conditions

**HDOP (Horizontal Dilution of Precision)**:
- Measures satellite geometry quality
- Lower number = better accuracy
- Ideal: 1.4 | Good: <3 | Poor: >6
- More satellites visible = better HDOP (like multiple position lines)

**Error Sources**:
1. **Signal Multipath**: Bounce from structures, poor aerial placement
2. **Shielding**: Metal objects, obstructions
3. **Time Errors**: Satellite clock drift
4. **User Error**: Incorrect waypoint entry (MOST COMMON!)

**Best Practices**:
- Aerial placement: Low, clear sky view, avoid signal bounce
- Always verify waypoints on paper chart
- Cross-check with visual fixes when coastal
- Monitor HDOP - if >4, treat position with caution

**Critical Teaching Point**:
"GPS tells you where you ARE, not where you SHOULD BE. Waypoint accuracy depends entirely on correct data entry."
