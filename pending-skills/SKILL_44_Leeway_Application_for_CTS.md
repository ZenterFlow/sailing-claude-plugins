# SKILL: Leeway Application for Course to Steer

## Description
Apply leeway correction to a True course to steer using the port/subtract, starboard/add rule, and understand why CTS leeway is opposite to EP leeway.

## Prerequisites
- SKILL_43 (CTS Vector Triangle)
- SKILL_36 (Leeway Fundamentals)

## Learning Objectives
- Apply leeway INTO WIND for CTS (vs downwind for EP)
- Use port/subtract, starboard/add rule correctly
- Determine wind side relative to vessel heading
- Apply leeway BEFORE variation/deviation in conversion sequence

## Core Principle
**CTS vs EP Leeway Difference:**
- **EP/DR Plotting:** Leeway moves vessel DOWNWIND (apply with wind)
- **CTS Calculation:** Leeway is COUNTERACTED by steering INTO wind (apply toward wind)

**Wind Side Determination:**
- **Wind on PORT side:** Vessel pushed to starboard
- **Wind on STARBOARD side:** Vessel pushed to port

**Application Rules:**
- **Port wind** → Steer to PORT (anticlockwise) → SUBTRACT leeway from True CTS
- **Starboard wind** → Steer to STARBOARD (clockwise) → ADD leeway to True CTS

**Conversion Sequence (CTS ONLY):**
1. **True CTS** (from water track)
2. **± Leeway** (port subtract, starboard add)
3. **± Variation** (west add, east subtract)
4. **± Deviation** (from table, compass→magnetic rules)
5. **Compass Course** (for helmsman)

**Example:**
- True CTS: 090°(T)
- Wind: Westerly (on PORT side)
- Leeway: 10°
- Calculation: 090° - 10° = 080°(T) (adjusted for leeway)

## Common Errors
- Applying leeway in wrong direction (confusing CTS vs EP)
- Applying leeway AFTER deviation (wrong order)
- Confusing port/starboard wind determination
- Forgetting to recalculate deviation after leeway change

## Assessment
- Correctly apply leeway for 6 scenarios (various wind directions)
- Explain directional logic without reference
- Complete CTS conversion sequence with leeway in &lt;2 minutes
- Identify wind side from given course and wind direction
