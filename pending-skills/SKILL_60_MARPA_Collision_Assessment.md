# SKILL: MARPA Target Tracking and Collision Assessment

## Description
Use Mini Automatic Radar Plotting Aid to track targets, interpret CPA/TCPA data, and assess collision risk limitations.

## Prerequisites
- Radar basics (SKILL_53)
- Collision avoidance fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
- Acquire and track targets using MARPA
- Interpret CPA and TCPA data
- Understand MARPA limitations vs full ARPA
- Assess CPA/TCPA reliability during maneuvers
- Make collision avoidance decisions using MARPA data

## MARPA Operation
**Target Acquisition:**
- Select target on radar screen (usually with cursor)
- System highlights with small box
- MARPA begins tracking relative motion
- Requires several radar sweeps to establish track

**Data Provided:**
- **CPA (Closest Point of Approach):** Distance at closest approach
- **TCPA (Time to CPA):** Time until closest approach
- **Target course/speed:** Relative and true values
- **Bearing/range:** Continuously updated

**MARPA vs ARPA:**
- **MARPA:** "Mini" version for small craft
- **ARPA:** Full version on commercial ships (Automatic Radar Plotting Aid)
- **MARPA limitations:** Less processing power, fewer targets, simpler algorithms
- **Common feature:** Both provide CPA/TCPA

**CPA/TCPA Interpretation:**
- **Safe:** CPA &gt; safe distance (e.g., 1 NM)
- **Dangerous:** CPA &lt; safe distance
- **Action needed:** TCPA gives time available to maneuver
- **Critical:** TCPA &lt; 15 minutes requires immediate assessment

**Reliability Issues:**
- **During target maneuver:** CPA/TCPA constantly changing
- **Example:** Vessel turning into traffic lane → unreliable while turning
- **Solution:** Wait for steady course before trusting data
- **Own ship maneuver:** Also affects CPA/TCPA reliability

**Collision Avoidance:**
- Establish safe passing distance
- Monitor CPA/TCPA for developing risks
- Use MARPA to assess effectiveness of avoidance maneuver
- **Rule:** Don't rely solely on MARPA - use visual lookout

## Common Errors
- Trusting MARPA data during target maneuvers
- Not waiting for track to establish (false sense of security)
- Ignoring visual lookout in favor of MARPA
- Forgetting MARPA only tracks radar targets

## Assessment
- Acquire target and interpret CPA/TCPA display
- Explain why CPA changes during target turn
- Set safe CPA limit for coastal passage
- Assess collision risk with given MARPA data
- Demonstrate when to disregard MARPA data
