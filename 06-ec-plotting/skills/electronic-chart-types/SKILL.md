# SKILL: electronic-chart-types
**RYA Yachtmaster – Electronic Chart Types (RNC vs ENC)**

## Purpose
Distinguish between Raster Navigational Charts (RNC) and Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC), understand their limitations, and interpret quality indicators.

## Activation Triggers
- "RNC vs ENC"
- "raster charts"
- "vector charts"
- "electronic chart types"

## Behaviour
**RNC (Raster Navigational Chart)**:
- Scanned bitmap image of paper chart
- Identical symbols/colors as paper chart
- ✅ Advantage: Familiar appearance, cost-effective
- ❌ Disadvantage: Cannot query data, zoom distorts (pixelation)
- ❌ Carries inherent paper chart errors
- ❌ Not suitable for ECDIS (commercial systems)

**ENC (Electronic Navigational Chart)**:
- Vector database from lines/points/areas
- Associated database with multiple information layers
- ✅ Advantage: Query objects, zoom without distortion, hazard alarms
- ✅ Required for official ECDIS systems
- ⚠️ Disadvantage: May not match paper chart appearance

**Zoom Behavior Comparison**:
- RNC: Larger pixels, blurs when zoomed
- ENC: Scales cleanly, shows more detail

**Quality Indicators**:
**Paper charts**: Source data diagram
- Shows survey year/method
- Example: "Lead line 1918" = old/unreliable data
- Modern multibeam sonar = high quality

**ENC/ECDIS**: Star rating system
- More stars = better quality, recent survey
- Check before navigating unfamiliar waters

**Recreational Plotters**:
- No standard quality representation
- Check manual for data quality indicators
- **Startup warning**: "Aid to navigation only"
- NOT primary navigation source!

**Critical Teaching Points**:
1. "RNC = picture of chart. ENC = database of data."
2. "Always check data quality - some charts are 100+ years old"
3. "Recreational charts ≠ Official charts"
