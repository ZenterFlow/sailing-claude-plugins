## Purpose

Master the IALA (International Association of Lighthouse Authorities) buoyage system framework - the global standard for maritime navigation aids. Understand the two regions (A and B) and the five core categories of navigation marks.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when you:
- Ask about IALA buoyage systems
- Need to know which region you're navigating in
- Inquire about "red to port" vs "green to port"
- Want to understand direction of buoyage
- Ask about navigation mark categories

## Behavior

### IALA System Overview

The IALA buoyage system is the global standard for maritime navigation aids, divided into two regions with nearly identical shapes but **inverted colors for lateral marks only**.

### IALA Region A

**Coverage:**
- Europe
- Australia, New Zealand
- Parts of Africa
- Most of Asia (excluding Philippines, Japan, Korea)
- Middle East

**Lateral Marks Rule:**
- **Red to PORT** (left) when proceeding in direction of buoyage
- **Green to STARBOARD** (right) when proceeding in direction of buoyage

**Memory Aid:** "Red to port" - think European standard

### IALA Region B

**Coverage:**
- North America
- Central America, South America
- Caribbean
- Philippines, Japan, Korea

**Lateral Marks Rule:**
- **Green to PORT** (left) when proceeding in direction of buoyage
- **Red to STARBOARD** (right) when proceeding in direction of buoyage

**Memory Aid:** "Green to port" - think American standard

### Direction of Buoyage

**Definition:**
The conventional direction taken when:
- Approaching a harbor from seaward
- Proceeding along coasts
- Generally clockwise around landmasses

**On Charts:**
- Shown as **magenta arrow** when clarification needed
- Critical for interpreting lateral marks correctly
- Set by national buoyage authorities

**Examples:**
- **Entering harbor**: Direction of buoyage points inward
- **English Channel**: Generally west to east
- **US East Coast**: Generally south to north

### Core Categories of Marks

**1. Lateral Marks** (Channel Sides)
- Indicate port and starboard sides of channels
- **ONLY** category that differs between regions (colors inverted)
- Shapes: Can, cone, pillar, spar
- Use when following defined channels

**2. Cardinal Marks** (Compass Directions)
- Indicate safe side to pass based on N/E/S/W
- **Identical worldwide** (no regional difference)
- Colors: Black and yellow
- Topmarks: Double cones
- Use for isolated hazards with navigable water around

**3. Isolated Danger Mark**
- Marks isolated hazards with navigable water all around
- **Identical worldwide**
- Colors: Black with red bands
- Topmark: Two black balls
- Safe to pass on any side (but not over it!)

**4. Safe Water Mark**
- Indicates safe deep water all around
- **Identical worldwide**
- Colors: Red and white vertical stripes
- Topmark: Single red ball
- Mid-channel mark or landfall buoy

**5. Special Marks**
- Indicate special areas or features
- **Identical worldwide**
- Color: Yellow
- Topmark: Yellow X
- Examples: Pipelines, race marks, spoil grounds, military areas

### Key Principle

**CRITICAL**: Only lateral mark colors change between IALA A and B.

Everything else is IDENTICAL worldwide:
- All shapes
- All light sequences
- All topmarks
- Cardinal, isolated danger, safe water, and special marks

### Regional Confusion Prevention

**When navigating:**
1. Check chart title - which IALA region?
2. Note direction of buoyage arrows
3. Remember your region's rule:
   - Region A: Red port, green starboard
   - Region B: Green port, red starboard
4. Cardinal marks are the same everywhere!

### Common Errors to Avoid

❌ Assuming ALL marks differ between regions (only lateral colors change)
❌ Confusing direction of buoyage when leaving vs entering
❌ Forgetting to check which region applies
❌ Mixing up "red to port" vs "green to port" mnemonics
❌ Applying regional rules to cardinal marks (they're global!)

### Assessment Criteria

You should be able to:
- Identify correct IALA region for any global location
- Explain lateral mark color scheme in both regions
- Interpret direction of buoyage from chart symbols
- List all five mark categories
- Explain which marks are regional vs global
- Navigate safely using appropriate regional rules

### Practical Application

**Scenario**: You're approaching Portsmouth Harbor (UK) from seaward

1. **Region check**: UK = IALA Region A
2. **Rule**: Red to port, green to starboard
3. **Direction**: Entering harbor = proceeding in direction of buoyage
4. **Action**: Keep red marks on your left, green on your right

**Scenario**: You're entering Newport, Rhode Island (USA) from sea

1. **Region check**: USA = IALA Region B
2. **Rule**: Green to port, red to starboard
3. **Direction**: Entering harbor = proceeding in direction of buoyage
4. **Action**: Keep green marks on your left, red on your right
