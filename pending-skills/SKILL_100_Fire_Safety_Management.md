# SKILL: Fire Safety, Prevention, and Extinguisher Management (SKILL_100)

## Description
Implement comprehensive fire prevention strategies, execute emergency fire response protocols, and maintain fire fighting equipment to protect vessel and crew from catastrophic fire events.

## Prerequisites
- Pre-Departure Safety Briefing and Equipment Verification (SKILL_098)
- LPG Gas System Safety Management and Leak Response (SKILL_099)

## Learning Objectives
- Deploy appropriate fire fighting equipment for different fire classes
- Execute engine compartment fire protocol without increasing risk
- Apply fire prevention measures throughout vessel
- Select and size extinguishers correctly for vessel compartments
- Maintain fire suppression systems to annual service standards

**Fire Fighting Equipment Deployment:**

**Extinguisher Selection by Fire Type:**
- **Flammable Liquids (Fuel, Oil):** AFFF (foam) extinguisher
- **Electrical Fires:** Dry powder extinguisher
- **General Cabin Fires:** Dry powder extinguisher
- **Galley Fires:** Fire blanket (primary), dry powder (backup)
- **Engine Compartment:** Automatic extinguisher system or access hole for manual discharge

**Extinguisher Placement Requirements:**
- **Galley:** Fire blanket PLUS dry powder extinguisher
- **Each Cabin:** Fire blanket in cabins without alternative exit
- **Every Cabin:** Minimum one dry powder extinguisher sized to volume
- **Engine Compartment:** Automatic fire extinguisher system
- **Exits:** Dry powder extinguisher within reach of each exit point

**Extinguisher Maintenance Protocol:**
- **Annual Professional Service:** All extinguishers serviced every year by certified technician
- **Monthly Crew Check:** 
  - Tilt dry powder units and listen for powder movement
  - Verify pressure gauge in green zone (if fitted)
  - Inspect for physical damage or corrosion
- **Replacement Criteria:** Replace immediately if pressure low, damaged, or after any discharge

**Emergency Fire Response Procedures:**

**Engine Compartment Fire (Critical Protocol):**
1. **NEVER OPEN ENGINE BAY** - Introducing oxygen causes flashback and intensifies fire
2. **Shut Engine Down:** Stop fuel supply and engine
3. **Activate Automatic System:** If fitted, allow automatic extinguisher to discharge
4. **Manual Discharge:** Use access hole to fire manual extinguisher into compartment
5. **Evacuate Area:** Keep crew away from compartment
6. **Prepare Abandon Ship:** If fire uncontrollable, launch life raft

**Galley Fire Response:**
1. **Fire Blanket First:** Smother flames with blanket (cut off oxygen)
2. **Shut Off Gas:** Turn off cooker and galley gas valve
3. **Extinguisher Backup:** Use dry powder if blanket insufficient
4. **Ventilate After:** Once fire out, ventilate area completely

**Cabin Fire Protocol:**
1. **Alert Crew:** Sound alarm and assign roles
2. **Evacuate Cabin:** Ensure no persons trapped
3. **Close Door:** Contain fire and reduce oxygen
4. **Discharge Extinguisher:** Use appropriate type through doorway
5. **Check for Spread:** Inspect adjacent compartments

**Fire Prevention Measures:**

**Structural Precautions:**
- Install fire flaps over all air intakes to engine/generator compartments
- Ensure pipe lagging is secure and fireproof
- Provide extinguisher access holes into engine/generator spaces
- Use fire retardant fabrics for upholstery and curtains
- Avoid large, flat deck areas that can trap flames

**Operational Precautions:**
- **NO SMOKING BELOW DECKS** - Absolute rule
- **Galley Supervision:** Never leave cooking unattended
- **Flammable Liquid Storage:** DO NOT stow paint, thinners, or solvents on board
- **Electrical Maintenance:** Keep all wiring and equipment well maintained
- **Fuel Filling:** Fill tanks to 7/8 maximum to prevent splash-back
- **Absorbent Collars:** Use fuel collars during refueling to catch drips

**Fire Detection:**
- Install smoke alarm in EVERY cabin
- Test smoke alarms monthly
- Consider heat detectors in engine compartment
- Maintain clear paths to all exits

**Crew Briefing Requirements:**
- Location and operation of every extinguisher and blanket
- Engine fire protocol (no opening compartment)
- Gas shut-off procedures
- Evacuation routes and muster points
- Fire detection alarm sounds

## Common Errors
- Opening engine compartment during fire (catastrophic flashback risk)
- Using wrong extinguisher type (water on electrical fire)
- Storing flammable liquids below decks
- Failing to service extinguishers annually
- Overloading galley power circuits
- Not having fire blanket in each cabin
- Delaying alarm or evacuation to "fight" fire alone

## Assessment
- Demonstrate correct extinguisher selection for fuel, electrical, and galley fires
- Execute engine compartment fire drill without opening bay
- Perform monthly dry powder extinguisher check (tilt and gauge)
- Identify all fire blankets and extinguishers with correct usage protocols
- Explain why fire flaps are critical and demonstrate closure
- Show proper fuel filling technique with absorbent collar
- Brief crew on fire evacuation routes and muster procedures
