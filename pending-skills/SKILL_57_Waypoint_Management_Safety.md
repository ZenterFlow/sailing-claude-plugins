# SKILL: Safe Waypoint Management and Entry

## Description
Create, verify, and manage waypoints safely to avoid navigation errors, ensuring waypoints are placed clear of hazards and entered correctly.

## Prerequisites
- Chart plotter operation (SKILL_51)
- Chart symbol recognition (SKILL_15)

## Learning Objectives
- Place waypoints offset from navigational aids (not directly on them)
- Verify waypoint positions on paper chart
- Avoid waypoint-assisted collisions
- Implement double-checking procedures
- Understand why buoys/markers make poor waypoints

## Safe Waypoint Practices
**Placement Rule:**
- **NEVER** place waypoints directly on navigation marks, buoys, or hazards
- **ALWAYS** offset to one side (prefer to leave buoy to port)
- **Rationale:** Allows easy avoidance maneuver if collision risk arises
- **Example:** Buoy waypoint → offset 0.1-0.2 NM to side of intended passage

**Verification Process:**
1. Plot waypoint on paper chart first
2. Verify not on hazard or mark
3. Measure bearing/distance to waypoint
4. Transfer coordinates to GPS/plotter
5. Double-check entered coordinates match plotted position
6. Test route at low speed before full passage

**Waypoint Entry Errors:**
- Transposition of digits (e.g., 45.123 → 45.213)
- Wrong hemisphere (N vs S, E vs W)
- Wrong datum (WGS84 vs chart datum)
- **Prevention:** Always verify on paper chart, have second person check

**Buoys as Waypoints - DANGEROUS:**
- Buoys can move (mooring failure)
- Other vessels may be near buoy
- **Better practice:** Use position near but offset from buoy
- Allows passing clear and safe maneuvering room

**Route Planning:**
- Plot intended ground track through waypoints
- Check track doesn't cross hazards
- Verify waypoints in correct sequence
- Name waypoints logically (e.g., "Harbor_Ent_1")

**Common Error Example:**
- Waypoint on buoy, vessel steers directly to buoy
- Another vessel near buoy → collision course
- **Solution:** Waypoint offset 0.1 NM past buoy, set arrival alarm 0.1 NM before

## Assessment
- Plot safe waypoints for harbor approach (offset from marks)
- Demonstrate verification process for waypoint entry
- Identify unsafe waypoint placement from diagram
- Explain why offset waypoints are safer than marks
- Double-check 5 waypoints for entry errors
