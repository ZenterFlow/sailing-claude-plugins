# Traffic Separation Schemes and Impeding

## Purpose
Navigate Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS) correctly, understand impeding obligations, and apply special vessel hierarchy rules for collision avoidance under IRPCS Rules 10 and 18.

## Description
This skill covers TSS navigation procedures (Rule 10), the crucial distinction between "impede" and "give way", and the vessel hierarchy system. Critical for navigating congested waters and understanding special vessel obligations.

## Activation Triggers
Use this skill when you need to:
- Navigate through a Traffic Separation Scheme
- Understand when to use inshore traffic zones
- Learn vessel hierarchy and pecking order
- Distinguish between "impede" and "give way" obligations
- Identify special vessel status (NUC, RAM, CBD, Fishing)
- Cross or join TSS lanes correctly

## Behaviour

### Traffic Separation Schemes (Rule 10)

**General Principles:**
- **Purpose:** Organize vessel traffic flow in congested areas
- **Regulation:** Mandatory compliance when scheme is adopted and charted
- **Does NOT Relieve:** Any vessel from obligations under other rules

**Vessels USING a Lane:**
- **Direction:** Proceed in general direction of traffic flow for that lane
- **Separation:** Keep clear of separation lines/zones as far as practicable
- **Lane Termination:** Normally join/leave at termination of lane
- **Joining/Leaving:** From either side, at smallest possible angle to traffic flow
- **Crossing:** Avoid crossing lanes when practicable

**Crossing Procedures (When Obliged):**
- **Angle:** Cross on heading as nearly as practicable at **RIGHT ANGLES** to traffic flow
- **Purpose:** Makes vessel's intention clear to traffic in lane
- **Speed:** Maintain steady speed during crossing
- **Visibility:** Show clear aspect to traffic in lane

### Inshore Traffic Zones (Rule 10(d))

**Who MAY Use:**
- Vessels under 20 meters in length
- Sailing vessels
- Vessels engaged in fishing
- Vessels en route to/from port within the zone
- Vessels avoiding immediate danger

**Who Should NOT Use:**
- Vessels that can safely use adjacent traffic lane

### Separation Zones (Rule 10(e))

**Entering/Crossing Separation Zone Permitted:**
- Emergency to avoid immediate danger
- Engaging in fishing within separation zone

**Otherwise:** Avoid separation zones

### Vessel Hierarchy and Pecking Order

**Rule 18 Priority List (HIGHER priority at TOP):**
1. **Not Under Command (NUC):** Unable to maneuver as required by rules
2. **Restricted in Ability to Manoeuvre (RAM):** Due to nature of work
3. **Constrained by Draught (CBD):** Limited to narrow channel by draft (special case - see below)
4. **Fishing Vessel:** Engaged in fishing (trawling/dredging)
5. **Sailing Vessel:** Under sail alone (not motor sailing)
6. **Power Driven Vessel:** Including motor sailing yachts

**General Pecking Order (Lower Must Give Way to Higher):**
- **Power Driven:** Gives way to all above
- **Sailing:** Gives way to RAM, NUC, fishing vessels
- **Fishing:** Gives way to RAM and NUC
- **RAM/NUC:** All others must give way to these

### "Impede" vs "Give Way" Distinction

**"Give Way" (Standard Crossing/Overtaking):**
- **Action:** Required to keep well clear of other vessel
- **Hierarchy:** Based on vessel type and encounter situation
- **Example:** Power vessel gives way to sailing vessel crossing from starboard

**"Not to Impede" (Special Obligation):**
- **Action:** Take early action to allow sufficient sea-room for safe passage
- **Obligation Continues:** Even if risk of collision develops
- **Does NOT Relieve Other Vessel:** Other vessel must still comply with give-way rules if risk develops
- **Example:** Small vessel must not impede CBD vessel in narrow channel, BUT if collision risk develops, CBD vessel must still give way per crossing rules

**Critical Understanding:**
CBD vessels have right not to be impeded, BUT they are still give-way vessels in crossing/overtaking situations if risk of collision develops.

### Special Vessel Identification

**Constrained by Draught (Rule 28):**
- **Day Shape:** Cylinder
- **Lights:** Three vertical red lights
- **Meaning:** Restricted to narrow channel by draft
- **Action:** Do not obstruct, but treat as give-way vessel in encounters

**Restricted in Ability to Manoeuvre (Rule 27):**
- **Day Shape:** Ball-diamond-ball vertically
- **Night Lights:** Red-white-red vertical all-round lights
- **Common Operations:** Underwater operations, dredging, cable laying, maintaining navigation aids

**Not Under Command (Rule 27):**
- **Day Shape:** Two black balls vertically
- **Night Lights:** Two vertical red lights
- **Meaning:** Severely restricted in ability to deviate from course

**Fishing Vessels (Rule 26):**
- **Trawling:** Green over white vertical lights, cone apexes together shape
- **Other Fishing:** Red over white vertical lights, cone apexes together shape
- **Gear Warning:** If gear extends >150m, white light or cone apex upward in gear direction

**Towing Operations (Rule 24):**
- **Length ≤200m:** RAM shapes/lights plus amber towing light
- **Length >200m:** Additional masthead light, diamond shapes showing length

### Traffic Separation Scheme Sound Signals

- **Vessel in TSS in fog:** 1 long blast every 2 minutes
- **Towing vessel:** 1 long + 2 short blasts every 2 minutes
- **Last vessel in tow:** 1 long + 3 short blasts every 2 minutes

## Common Errors to Avoid

- Failing to cross TSS at right angles
- Using inshore zone when able to safely use traffic lane
- Assuming CBD vessel has absolute right of way (forgetting give-way obligations)
- Not understanding "impede" continues even after risk develops
- Crossing separation zones without emergency justification
- Anchoring in TSS lane (prohibited)
- Misidentifying vessel hierarchy from lights/shapes

## Assessment Criteria

Competency demonstrated by:
- Executing correct TSS joining/leaving/crossing procedure
- Identifying vessel hierarchy from lights/shapes and applying correct action
- Distinguishing between "give way" and "not to impede" situations
- Navigating narrow channel without impeding larger vessels
- Determining when inshore zone usage is permitted
- Applying correct sound signals in TSS during restricted visibility
- Analyzing complex multi-vessel encounter with hierarchy rules
