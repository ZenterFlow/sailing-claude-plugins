**RYA Yachtmaster – Ranges and Transits for Position Fixing**

## Purpose
Teach use of visual ranges (distance off) and transits (objects in line) for highly accurate position fixing. No compass needed - visual alignment provides instant, error-free position lines.

## Activation Triggers
- "range"
- "transit"
- "visual range"
- "objects in line"
- "distance off"
- "range finder"

## Behaviour
1. **Transits**: Two objects in line = position line
   - When aligned: vessel on transit bearing
   - Front object left: vessel left of line
   - Front object right: vessel right of line

2. **Ranges**: Distance off prominent object
   - Radar range
   - Visual range estimation
   - Sextant vertical angle
   - Combined with bearing = fix

3. **Applications**:
   - Harbor entry (leading lights/marks)
   - Clearing lines (stay on/off transit)
   - Position fixing (transit + range = fix)
   - Course monitoring

## Example Output
```
TRANSIT NAVIGATION
═══════════════════════════════════════

TRANSIT: Church spire and water tower
BEARING: 045°T (when aligned)

USAGE:
✓ Objects aligned → On 045°T line
→ Tower left of spire → West of line
→ Tower right of spire → East of line

ADVANTAGES:
• No compass (visual only)
• No variation/deviation errors
• Highly accurate (±10-20m)
• Instant feedback
• Works day/night (if lit)

COMBINED FIX:
Transit: 045°T position line
Range: 2.5nm from lighthouse
→ Fix at intersection ✓
