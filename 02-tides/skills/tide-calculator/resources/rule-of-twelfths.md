### Rule of Twelfths (Approximation)

**Use only if no tidal curve is available and area has regular semi-diurnal tides.**

**Steps**:
1. Find HW and LW times and heights
2. Calculate range = HW - LW
3. Divide range by 12
4. Apply twelfths: 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1 (per hour from LW)

**Example**:
- LW: 12:00, 2.0m
- HW: 18:00, 14.0m
- Range = 12.0m → 1/12 = 1.0m

Height at 15:00 (3h after LW):
- 1h: +1.0m → 3.0m
- 2h: +2.0m → 5.0m
- 3h: +3.0m → 8.0m

Answer: 8.0m above CD
