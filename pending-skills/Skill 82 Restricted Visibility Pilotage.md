# SKILL: Restricted Visibility Pilotage (SKILL_82)

## Description
Execute safe pilotage in fog, rain, or reduced visibility using depth contours, radar, and GPS while maintaining proper watchkeeping discipline.

## Prerequisites
- Pilotage Planning Methods (SKILL_81)

## Learning Objectives
- Apply depth contour navigation in poor visibility
- Use radar and GPS as secondary tools
- Maintain effective watch by all available means
- Position vessel to locate buoys in fog
- Avoid false sense of security from electronic navigation

**Reduced Visibility Challenges**
- **Visibility Range:** May be limited to 0.5 nautical miles or less
- **Visual References:** Limited or no visible landmarks
- **Buoy Detection:** Cannot rely on sighting marks at normal distances
- **Depth Perception:** Even more critical than in clear conditions

**Depth Contour Navigation**
**Primary Technique:** Depth contours become your best friend in fog
- **Safe Corridor:** Follow contour lines that keep you clear of all hazards
- **Depth Monitoring:** Continuous depth sounder watch essential
- **HOT Correction:** Always add Height of Tide to charted depths
- **Contour Tracking:** Use depth to confirm staying on planned line

**Buoy Location Strategy**
**When buoy is positioned on a depth contour:**
1. **Approach Strategy:** Aim to one side of buoy's charted position
2. **Circle of Error:** Use 10% of travel distance as safety margin
3. **Contour Intercept:** Proceed to contour line where buoy should be
4. **Direction Decision:** When reaching contour, you know which way to turn to find buoy
5. **Search Pattern:** Follow contour toward charted buoy position

**Example:**
- **Distance to Buoy:** 2 miles
- **Safety Margin:** Aim 0.2 miles to one side of charted position
- **Result:** When depth contour reached, turn toward buoy knowing you're on safe side

**Radar Use in Pilotage**
- **Primary Role:** Secondary tool, not primary navigation method
- **Experienced Operator:** Requires skilled interpretation
- **Target Identification:** Cross-reference with GPS and depth
- **Range Setting:** Use appropriate scales for close-quarters navigation
- **Limitations:** Cannot detect all hazards (rocks, shallow areas without signatures)

**GPS/Chartplotter Use**
- **Position Verification:** Confirm location against planned track
- **Track Monitoring:** Ensure vessel stays within safe corridors
- **Limitation:** Gives position only, not hazard awareness
- **False Security:** Below-deck monitoring dangerous without external watch

**Proper Watchkeeping Discipline**
- **Skipper Position:** On deck with pilot plan and hand bearing compass
- **Crew Assignment:** Experienced radar operator below if available
- **All Available Means:** 
  - Visual (limited but critical)
  - Auditory (fog horns, bells, whistles)
  - Depth sounder
  - Radar
  - GPS
- **Action Readiness:** Positioned to act quickly if hazard detected

**Hazard Detection Priorities**
1. **Depth Sounder:** Immediate warning of shoaling
2. **Radar:** Surface objects, other vessels, aids to navigation
3. **GPS:** Position verification against plan
4. **Visual:** Any break in visibility, buoy sightings
5. **Auditory:** Signals from other vessels or navigation marks

**Communication**
- **Port Contact:** Use VHF to confirm conditions and traffic
- **Securité Calls:** Make position reports when appropriate
- **Channel Monitoring:** Listen for other vessel traffic

**Port Reference Information**
- **Pilot Books:** Include port lights, VHF channels, limits, depths, facilities
- **RYA Almanac:** Standard reference for training (specific page numbers for locations)
- **Local Knowledge:** Gather additional local information when possible

**Emergency Actions**
- **If Unsure:** Heave to or anchor in safe depth if possible
- **Sound Signals:** Comply with COLREGS fog signals
- **Position Fixing:** Use all available means to verify position before proceeding

## Common Errors
- Attempting pilotage from below deck using only electronics
- Not assigning experienced radar operator in restricted visibility
- Forgetting to add Height of Tide to depth contour depths
- Relying on GPS alone without depth monitoring
- Failing to maintain proper fog signals
- Not using adequate safety margin when intercepting buoys

## Assessment
- Create restricted visibility passage plan using depth contours
- Execute buoy location using contour intercept method
- Demonstrate proper watchkeeping station assignment
- Apply 10% circle of error for safe approach
- Respond to simulated depth shoaling in fog
