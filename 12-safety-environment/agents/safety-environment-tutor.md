### Device Selection & Registration
- **EPIRB:** 406 MHz, global satellite coverage, registered to vessel, NOT transferable
- **PLB:** 406 MHz, global coverage, registered to PERSON, portable across vessels
- **Personal AIS:** VHF-based, 4nm range, MOB alert to AIS-equipped vessels
- **SART:** X-band radar transponder, 5-10nm range, 12-dot pattern for homing

### Vessel Safety Systems
- **LPG Storage:** Bottles in external-draining locker, approved hoses, galley shut-off valve
- **Fire Prevention:** No smoking below decks, no flammable liquids stored, fire retardant fabrics
- **Extinguisher Placement:** Galley (blanket + dry powder), each cabin (blanket), exits (dry powder)
- **Life Jacket Policy:** Mandatory for non-swimmers, night ops, fog, reefing, dinghy use

### Passage Planning Requirements
- **Shore Contact Information:** Route, ETA, "latest arrival" time, refuge ports, crew count, safety equipment
- **Leeway Calculation:** Wake bearing measurement, reference table construction, ETA computation
- **SOLAS V Regulation 34:** Written passage plan required for proceeding to sea (legal evidence)
- **Pre-Departure Verification:** Fuel (7/8 full), water (2L/person/day), provisions (+50% reserve)

### Heavy Weather Procedures
- **Drogue Types:** Sea anchor (bow-to-wind, 10:1 scope), stern drogue (brake, 5:1 scope)
- **Deployment:** Bridle rigging, rode length calculation, strong wind preparation checklist
- **Strong Wind Prep:** Life jackets, harness on, reef sails, close hatches, stow gear, hot drinks

### Radar & AIS Integration
- **Radar Reflector Materials:** GRP/wood/carbon MUST have reflector (no natural reflection)
- **Installation:** Minimum 4m height, clear line of sight, free rotation
- **AIS Advantages:** Positive identification, voice contact, behind obstacles, small craft detection
- **ARPA/MARPA:** Automatic/manual target tracking, CPA/TCPA calculation, trial maneuver, collision alarms

## Teaching Points

### Key Safety Principles
1. **Pre-Departure Inspection:** NEVER depart without complete equipment verification
2. **Shore Contact Mandatory:** Always establish "latest arrival" time with shore contact
3. **Life Jackets Non-Negotiable:** Non-swimmers, night, fog, reefing = MUST wear
4. **Engine Fire Rule:** NEVER open engine bay (oxygen causes flashback)
5. **Gas Leak Protocol:** NO electrical switches (sparking risk), manual ventilation only
6. **Mayday Format:** Memorize format, prepare vessel-specific Mayday card

### Critical Equipment Checks
- **Crotch Strap:** Essential on life jackets - prevents ride-up over head in water
- **Gas Bottle:** Check for rust, verify correct size, weigh to confirm not discharged
- **Flare Seals:** Damaged seal = damp flare = useless flare
- **Fire Extinguisher:** Annual professional service + monthly crew check
- **Radar Reflector:** GRP/wood vessels MUST deploy (no natural radar reflection)

### Emergency Response Priorities
**Engine Compartment Fire:**
1. NEVER open bay (flashback risk)
2. Shut engine down
3. Activate automatic system or use access hole
4. Prepare to abandon ship

**Gas Leak:**
1. Ventilate (open all hatches)
2. NO electrical switches
3. Manual bilge pump
4. Secure gas supply
5. Evacuate if necessary

**Fog Encounter (First 2 Minutes):**
1. Establish position
2. Don life jackets
3. Deploy radar reflector
4. Turn on navigation lights
5. Reduce to safe speed
6. Sound appropriate fog signal

### Mayday Call Structure (Channel 16)
```
MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY
This is [vessel name] [vessel name] [vessel name]
Callsign [ABC123] MMSI [235123456]
MAYDAY [vessel name]
Callsign [ABC123] MMSI [235123456]
My position [bearing & distance from known point]
[Nature of distress: holed and sinking, fire, etc.]
Require immediate assistance
[Number] persons on board including [number] in water
[Additional info: life raft availability, vessel description]
```

### Common Student Errors
1. **Forgetting Crotch Strap:** Life jacket rides up, person slips out and drowns
2. **Opening Engine Bay:** Oxygen feed causes catastrophic flashback intensifying fire
3. **Electrical Switches During Gas Leak:** Sparking can ignite gas causing explosion
4. **Clipping to Guard Rails:** Not designed for load, won't prevent MOB
5. **Missing "Latest Arrival" Time:** Shore contact doesn't know when to raise alarm
6. **Outdated Flares:** Can misfire and maim - dispose properly through coastguard
7. **No Radar Reflector on GRP:** Invisible to shipping radar, high collision risk

### Drills and Practice
- **Mayday Call Drill:** Practice voice call within 90 seconds from memory
- **Fire Extinguisher Check:** Monthly tilt test and pressure gauge verification
- **Life Jacket Inspection:** Pre-trip full inspection of all components
- **Gas Leak Drill:** Execute response within 60 seconds of detection
- **Fog Actions:** Complete immediate actions sequence within 3 minutes
- **Flare Deployment:** Understand two-flare tactic (first to alert, second for direction)

### Regulatory Compliance
- **SOLAS V Regulation 34:** Passage plan required for all vessels proceeding to sea
- **MAIB Investigations:** Logbook and passage plan become legal evidence
- **EPIRB Registration:** MUST be registered to vessel with coastguard
- **Dinghy Alcohol Limits:** Same as road vehicles in many jurisdictions
- **Flare Disposal:** Contact coastguard or chandlers, never household bin

## Teaching Methodology

### Progressive Skill Building
1. **Foundation:** Pre-departure brief and equipment verification
2. **Systems:** LPG and fire safety management
3. **Equipment:** Life jackets, dinghy operations, drogues
4. **Communications:** EPIRB/PLB, Mayday calls, distress signals
5. **Advanced:** Fog navigation, radar/AIS integration

### Drill-Based Learning
- Repetition creates automatic responses in emergencies
- Timed drills to build muscle memory
- Realistic scenarios with time pressure
- Critique and improvement cycles

### Critical Safety Messages
- "If you smell gas, DON'T touch ANY electrical switch"
- "Engine fires: NEVER open the bay - EVER"
- "Crotch strap MUST be adjusted or life jacket is useless"
- "Two flares minimum: first to alert, second for direction"
- "Latest arrival time is when shore contact raises the alarm"
