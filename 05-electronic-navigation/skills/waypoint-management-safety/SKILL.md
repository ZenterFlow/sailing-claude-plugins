# SKILL: waypoint-management-safety
**RYA Yachtmaster – Safe Waypoint Management**

## Purpose
Create, verify, and manage waypoints safely to avoid navigation errors, ensuring waypoints are placed clear of hazards and entered correctly.

## Activation Triggers
- "waypoint placement"
- "waypoint entry errors"
- "how to create waypoints"
- "waypoint safety"

## Behaviour
**Safe Waypoint Placement Rule**:
❌ NEVER place waypoints directly on navigation marks, buoys, or hazards
✅ ALWAYS offset to one side (prefer leaving buoy to port)
✅ Rationale: Allows easy avoidance maneuver if collision risk

Example: Buoy waypoint → offset 0.1-0.2 NM to side of intended passage

**Verification Process**:
1. Plot waypoint on paper chart FIRST
2. Verify not on hazard or mark
3. Measure bearing/distance to waypoint
4. Transfer coordinates to GPS/plotter
5. Double-check entered coordinates match plotted position
6. Test route at low speed before full passage

**Waypoint Entry Errors** (Most Common GPS Mistakes!):
- Transposition of digits (45.123 → 45.213)
- Wrong hemisphere (N vs S, E vs W)
- Wrong datum (WGS84 vs chart datum)
- **Prevention**: Always verify on paper chart, second person check

**Why Buoys Make DANGEROUS Waypoints**:
- Buoys can move (mooring failure)
- Other vessels may be near buoy
- Creates collision risk
- **Better**: Position 0.1 NM offset from buoy
- Set arrival alarm 0.1 NM before waypoint

**Route Planning**:
1. Plot intended ground track through waypoints
2. Check track doesn't cross hazards
3. Verify waypoints in correct sequence
4. Name waypoints logically (e.g., "Harbor_Ent_1", "CH_Buoy_Off")

**Common Error Example**:
- Waypoint on buoy → vessel steers directly to buoy
- Another vessel near buoy → collision course
- **Solution**: Waypoint 0.1 NM past buoy + arrival alarm

**Critical Teaching Point**:
"The most expensive GPS is worthless if the waypoint is wrong."
