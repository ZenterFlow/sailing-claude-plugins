- Ability to read chart symbols correctly

### Typical Question Formats

#### 1. Definition Questions
"Define the following terms: MHWS, MLWS, Chart Datum, HAT"

**Expected Answer Quality**:
- Exact definition
- Practical application
- Position relative to other datums

#### 2. Calculation Questions
"Calculate the total depth at a position marked 8.5m at 1400 when tide height is 3.2m above CD."

**Expected Process**:
- State formula
- Show working
- Include units
- Give clear answer

#### 3. Range Calculations
"Given MHWS 6.2m, MLWS 0.8m, MHWN 4.8m, MLWN 2.2m. Calculate spring and neap ranges."

**Expected Answer**:
- Spring Range = MHWS - MLWS = 6.2 - 0.8 = 5.4m

#### 4. Application Questions
"What datum is used for: a) bridge clearances, b) light elevations, c) charted depths?"

**Expected Answer**:
- a) HAT (modern charts, check notes)
- b) MHWS

#### 5. Safety Questions
"Can you safely cross a bar with drying height 1.7m if the tide is 4.5m, your draught is 2.2m, and you require 0.5m UKC?"

**Expected Process**:
```
Water depth = 4.5 - 1.7 = 2.8m
Available UKC = 2.8 - 2.2 = 0.6m
Required UKC = 0.5m
Decision: YES (0.6 > 0.5) ✓
```

## Essential Knowledge Matrix

### Must Know by Heart

| Term | Definition | Typical Value* | Used For |
|------|------------|----------------|----------|
| CD | Zero reference plane | 0.0m | All depths/heights |
| LAT | Lowest predictable tide | ≈ 0.0m | CD basis |
| MLWS | Average spring low | +0.8m | Spring range |
| MLWN | Average neap low | +2.2m | Neap range |
| MHWN | Average neap high | +4.8m | Neap range |
| MHWS | Average spring high | +6.2m | Spring range, lights |
| HAT | Highest predictable tide | +7.0m | Clearances |
| Range | HW - LW difference | 2.6-5.4m | Tidal calculations |

*Example location with 5.4m spring range

### Critical Formulas

**Depths**:
```
Total depth = Charted depth + Height of tide
Depth over drying = Height of tide - Drying height
UKC = Total depth - Draught
```

**Ranges**:
```
Spring Range = MHWS - MLWS
Neap Range = MHWN - MLWN
```

**Clearances**:
```
Bridge clearance = Charted + (HAT - Current tide)
Light height = Light elevation + MHWS - Current tide
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Confusing CD with MSL
**Wrong**: "Chart Datum is the same as Mean Sea Level"
**Right**: "Chart Datum is near LAT, not MSL. CD is at the BOTTOM of the tidal range, MSL is in the MIDDLE."

### 2. Using Wrong Datum for Clearances
**Wrong**: "Bridge clearance is always above MHWS"
**Right**: "Modern charts use HAT; older charts may use MHWS. Always check chart notes!"

### 3. Mixing Up Charted Depth and Drying Height
**Wrong**: "Add drying height to tide to get depth"
**Right**: "SUBTRACT drying height from tide. Drying heights are ABOVE CD, not below."

### 4. Forgetting Units
**Wrong**: "Total depth = 8.5 + 3.2 = 11.7"
**Right**: "Total depth = 8.5m + 3.2m = 11.7m" (always include units!)

### 5. Getting Vertical Order Wrong
**Wrong**: "MLWS is higher than MLWN"
**Right**: "MLWN is higher than MLWS (neap low is higher than spring low)"

### 6. Miscalculating Range
**Wrong**: "Range = MHWS - MLWN"
**Right**: "Spring Range = MHWS - MLWS (both S), Neap Range = MHWN - MLWN (both N)"

### 7. Assuming CD = LAT Everywhere
**Wrong**: "Chart Datum always equals LAT"
**Right**: "CD ≈ LAT in UK, but datums vary worldwide. Always check chart notes."

### 8. Negative UKC Interpretation
**Wrong**: "UKC = -0.5m means 0.5m clearance"
**Right**: "UKC = -0.5m means you'll GROUND by 0.5m! Negative UKC = UNSAFE"

## Exam Practice Questions

### Set 1: Definitions (2 marks each)

1. Define Chart Datum.
2. What is MHWS?
3. Explain HAT and state its use.
4. What does MLWN stand for?

### Set 2: Calculations (5 marks each)

5. Charted depth 7.2m, tide 4.1m. Calculate total depth.
   **Answer**: 7.2 + 4.1 = 11.3m

6. Drying height 2.5m, tide 3.8m. Calculate water depth.
   **Answer**: 3.8 - 2.5 = 1.3m

7. MHWS 5.8m, MLWS 1.2m. Calculate spring range.
   **Answer**: 5.8 - 1.2 = 4.6m

8. MHWN 4.5m, MLWN 2.1m. Calculate neap range.
   **Answer**: 4.5 - 2.1 = 2.4m

### Set 3: Application (10 marks each)

9. You have draught 2.3m and require 0.5m UKC. Charted depth is 5.8m. Tide is 1.9m. Are you safe?
   **Answer**: Total depth = 5.8 + 1.9 = 7.7m. UKC = 7.7 - 2.3 = 5.4m. YES, SAFE ✓

10. Drying height 1.8m. Your draught 2.5m. You need 0.5m UKC. What minimum tide height?
    **Answer**: Required = 1.8 + 2.5 + 0.5 = 4.8m above CD

11. Bridge clearance "25m", HAT 7.2m, current tide 5.5m. Your mast is 19m. Can you pass?
    **Answer**: Actual clearance = 25 + (7.2 - 5.5) = 26.7m. Mast 19m. YES, SAFE ✓

12. Light elevation "32m" above MHWS. MHWS is 6.0m above CD. Tide is 3.5m. Height of light above current water?
    **Answer**: Total = 32 + 6.0 = 38.0m above CD. Above water = 38.0 - 3.5 = 34.5m

## Quick Drill Questions (Practice Until Instant)

1. "CD?" → "Chart Datum, zero reference for depths, ≈ LAT"
2. "HAT?" → "Highest Astronomical Tide, for bridge clearances"
3. "MHWS?" → "Mean High Water Springs, for light elevations"
4. "Spring range formula?" → "MHWS minus MLWS"
5. "Drying height?" → "Height above CD, underlined on chart"
6. "Total depth?" → "Charted depth plus height of tide"
7. "UKC?" → "Under-keel clearance, depth minus draught"
8. "Which higher, MLWN or MLWS?" → "MLWN (neap low is higher)"
9. "Clearance datum?" → "HAT on modern charts, check notes"
10. "Light datum?" → "MHWS"

---

## Final Exam Tips

1. **Read chart notes** - datum used varies by chart age/region
2. **Show all working** - partial credit for correct method
3. **Include units** - always use meters (m)
4. **Check sign** - negative UKC = grounding!
5. **Know the hierarchy** - HAT highest, LAT lowest, CD ≈ LAT
6. **Underlined = drying** - subtract from tide, don't add
7. **Safety margins** - 0.5m power, 1.0m sail minimum
8. **Range = HW - LW** - both must be same type (springs or neaps)
9. **CD ≠ MSL** - common trick question
10. **Practice, practice, practice** - speed and accuracy come with repetition
