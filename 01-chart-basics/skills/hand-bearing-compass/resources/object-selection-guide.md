# Object Selection Guide for Hand Bearing Compass Position Fixing

## The Importance of Good Object Selection

**Why it matters:**
- Poor objects = poor fix quality
- Good bearing spread = small cocked hat
- Unambiguous identification = accurate position
- Chartability = ability to plot

**Golden Rule:**
Select objects BEFORE starting bearings. Don't take bearing first and then try to identify object on chart.

## Ideal Objects for Position Fixing

### 1. Lighthouses

**Why Excellent:**
- ✓ Clearly marked on charts with precise position
- ✓ Highly visible (purpose-built to be seen)
- ✓ Unambiguous (unique structures)
- ✓ Often elevated (good range)
- ✓ Day marks visible even if light not operating
- ✓ Coordinates published in almanacs

**Best Practices:**
- Sight on lighthouse structure, not light itself
- Use base of lighthouse if visible, or center of structure
- Cross-reference chart symbol with pilot book description
- Note: Some lighthouses are on towers offshore (excellent for bearings)

**Example:**
```
Chart Symbol: Lt Ho (Fl.3s 25m 15M)
Description: White tower, red top
Bearing target: Center of tower structure
Chart position: Precise lat/long marked
Quality: Excellent ✓✓✓
```

---

### 2. Church Spires and Towers

**Why Excellent:**
- ✓ Prominent vertical features
- ✓ Often highest point in area
- ✓ Charted with position
- ✓ Easy to identify from pilot book
- ✓ Stable, permanent structures

**Cautions:**
- Must be specifically charted (not all churches shown)
- Similar churches in same area can cause confusion
- Must positively identify correct one
- Some churches may be hidden by trees/buildings from sea

**Best Practices:**
- Check pilot book for description
- Look for unique features (spire shape, color)
- Confirm only one church charted in that direction
- Sight on spire top or center of tower

**Example:**
```
Chart Symbol: ⛪ (church symbol with cross)
Description: "Church spire (conspic)"
Bearing target: Spire top
Chart position: Marked on chart
Quality: Excellent ✓✓✓

Caution: If multiple churches, verify identification
```

---

### 3. Prominent Headlands

**Why Good:**
- ✓ Clearly defined geographic features
- ✓ Appear on all charts
- ✓ Easy to identify visually
- ✓ Large, cannot be missed
- ✓ Provide broad bearing indication

**Cautions:**
- Lower precision (which exact point on headland?)
- May have multiple outlying rocks (which to sight on?)
- Distance affects accuracy (far headland = less precise)

**Best Practices:**
- Sight on extreme point of headland
- Use highest/most prominent point if visible
- Check chart for specific named features on headland
- Better for third bearing than primary fix

**Example:**
```
Chart Feature: Named headland (e.g., "Start Point")
Description: Distinctive profile, highest cliff
Bearing target: Extreme visible point
Chart position: Point of land clearly shown
Quality: Good ✓✓

Note: Less precise than lighthouse, but useful
```

---

### 4. Radio/Communication Masts

**Why Good:**
- ✓ Very tall, visible from long range
- ✓ Charted with symbol and light characteristics
- ✓ Often in groups (take bearing on center)
- ✓ Usually marked as conspicuous

**Cautions:**
- Groups of masts can be confusing (which one?)
- May look similar to other masts in area
- Some masts not charted
- Bearing may be to group center, not specific mast

**Best Practices:**
- Check chart for mast groups vs. individual masts
- Use center of group if multiple masts
- Verify height on chart (tallest most visible)
- Cross-reference with pilot book

**Example:**
```
Chart Symbol: Mast symbol with height notation
Description: "R Mast (3) 200m (conspic)"
Bearing target: Center of mast group
Chart position: Precise position marked
Quality: Good ✓✓

Note: "(3)" means three masts in group
```

---

### 5. Water Towers and Standpipes

**Why Good:**
- ✓ Tall structures, often conspicuous
- ✓ Charted if prominent
- ✓ Usually unique in area
- ✓ Good visibility

**Cautions:**
- Must be specifically charted (not all towers shown)
- Sometimes hidden by terrain
- May be similar structures nearby

**Best Practices:**
- Verify charted as conspicuous feature
- Check pilot book description
- Use only if clearly identifiable

**Example:**
```
Chart Symbol: Water tower symbol
Description: "Water Twr (conspic)"
Bearing target: Center of tower
Chart position: Marked on chart
Quality: Good ✓✓
```

---

### 6. Large Industrial Structures

**Why Sometimes Good:**
- ✓ Chimneys, cooling towers often very tall
- ✓ May be charted as conspicuous
- ✓ Unique profiles

**Cautions:**
- Not all industrial structures charted
- May be difficult to identify specific one
- Pilot book may have limited info
- Structures can be demolished/built (chart outdated)

**Best Practices:**
- Only use if shown on chart as conspicuous
- Verify structure still exists (recent chart)
- Better for confirmation than primary fix

---

## Objects to AVOID

### 1. Low-Lying Features

**Why Poor:**
- ✗ Houses, buildings near shore
- ✗ Beaches, low dunes
- ✗ Piers, jetties (unless substantial)
- ✗ Trees, vegetation

**Problems:**
- Difficult to sight accurately
- May be obscured by waves, haze
- Ambiguous (which house? which tree?)
- May not appear on chart level you're using

**Exception:**
Large pier heads, if charted and prominent

---

### 2. Similar Grouped Features

**Why Poor:**
- ✗ Row of identical houses
- ✗ Marina with many masts
- ✗ Forest edge (no specific point)
- ✗ Group of similar boats at anchor

**Problems:**
- Cannot identify specific feature
- Bearing imprecise (to which one?)
- Chart doesn't show individual features

---

### 3. Moving or Temporary Features

**Why Poor:**
- ✗ Vessels at anchor
- ✗ Moored boats
- ✗ Buoys (unless major navigation buoy, and even then...)
- ✗ Temporary structures

**Problems:**
- Position not fixed
- May have moved/dragged
- Buoys can be off station
- Not reliable for position fixing

**Exception:**
Major light floats, if recently confirmed on station

---

### 4. Distant or Indistinct Features

**Why Poor:**
- ✗ Features >10-15 NM away
- ✗ Hazy, obscured objects
- ✗ Features seen "in line" with others
- ✗ Small features at long range

**Problems:**
- Bearing accuracy decreases with range
- Haze introduces error
- Difficult to sight precisely
- Small bearing error = large position error

---

### 5. Uncharted Features

**Why Poor:**
- ✗ Visible structure but not on chart
- ✗ New construction since chart published
- ✗ Private buildings
- ✗ Temporary installations

**Problems:**
- Cannot plot position line (no chart reference)
- Wasted bearing (doesn't contribute to fix)
- May confuse with charted feature

## Bearing Spread Optimization

### Two-Object Fix

**Ideal Spread:**
```
Vessel position
     (You)
       │
       │  90° ← Ideal
       │╱
       ╱
      ╱ ← Object B
     ╱
Object A

Best: 60-90° between objects
Acceptable: 45-120° between objects
Poor: <30° or >150° between objects
```

**Why Spread Matters:**
```
GOOD SPREAD (90°):           POOR SPREAD (30°):
    Object A                     Object A
         ╲                            ╲
          ╲                            ╲
           ╲                            ╲ ← Small error
            ╲                            ╲   creates large
         You ●                            ╲  position error
              ╲                            ╲
               ╲                            ╲
           Object B                      Object B
                                              │
Small error → small position error     │← You (uncertain)

```

---

### Three-Object Fix

**Ideal Spread:**
```
        Object A
            │
            │
       You ●─────── Object B  (each ~120° apart)
            │
            │
        Object C

Best: 120° between each object
Good: 60° between each object
Acceptable: 45-90° between objects
Poor: All objects in same quadrant (<90° total)
```

**Cocked Hat Quality:**
```
GOOD SPREAD:                POOR SPREAD:
    A                          A─────B
    │╲                              ╲
    │ ╲                              ╲
    │  ●                              ╲
   ╱   │                               ● You
  ╱    │                               (uncertain)
 C─────B
Small triangle = good fix       Long thin triangle = poor fix
```

## Selection Procedure (Practical)

### Step 1: Survey Available Objects

**Before starting:**
1. Look around horizon
2. Identify prominent features
3. Check which are charted
4. Assess visibility/clarity

**Mental list:**
```
Example:
"I can see:
 - Lighthouse to port (definitely charted)
 - Church spire on hill (probably charted)
 - Water tower to starboard (need to check chart)
 - Several houses (probably not chartable)
 - Headland behind us (charted for sure)"
```

---

### Step 2: Check Chart

**For each potential object:**
1. Can I find it on chart?
2. Is position precise?
3. Is identification unambiguous?
4. Is symbol clear?

**Chart review:**
```
✓ Lighthouse: Yes, clear symbol at position X
✓ Church spire: Yes, marked with cross at position Y
✓ Water tower: Yes, "Water Twr (conspic)" at position Z
✗ Houses: No, not shown at this chart scale
✓ Headland: Yes, named headland at position W
```

---

### Step 3: Check Bearing Spread

**Rough bearing estimation:**
1. Point at each object with hand
2. Estimate angles between them
3. Choose combination with best spread

**Example decision:**
```
Option 1: Lighthouse (045°) + Church (120°) = 75° spread ✓
Option 2: Lighthouse (045°) + Tower (080°) = 35° spread ✗
Option 3: Lighthouse (045°) + Church (120°) + Headland (280°)
          = 75° + 160° spread ✓✓

Decision: Use Option 3 (three objects, good spread)
```

---

### Step 4: Positive Identification

**Confirm each object:**
1. Read chart description
2. Check pilot book if available
3. Verify unique features
4. No ambiguity

**Confirmation checklist:**
```
Lighthouse:
  Chart: "Lt Ho Fl.3s 15M white tower"
  Visual: White tower, flashing light (if night)
  Unique: Only lighthouse in this direction ✓

Church:
  Chart: "Ch (conspic)"
  Pilot: "St. Mary's church, prominent spire"
  Visual: Stone tower with pointed spire
  Unique: Tallest spire in village ✓

Headland:
  Chart: "Portland Bill"
  Visual: Distinct pointed headland
  Unique: Southernmost point of peninsula ✓
```

---

## Real-World Example

**Scenario:** Approaching harbor from south

**Step 1 - Survey:**
```
Visible features:
- Lighthouse on breakwater (dead ahead)
- Church spire on hillside (port beam)
- Water tower (port quarter)
- Marina masts (too many, indistinct)
- Headland (starboard beam)
```

**Step 2 - Check Chart:**
```
✓ Lighthouse: Yes, "Bkwtr Lt" at harbor entrance
✓ Church: Yes, "Ch (conspic) St. Michael's"
✓ Water tower: Yes, "Water Twr"
✗ Marina: No individual masts shown
✓ Headland: Yes, "Black Head"
```

**Step 3 - Check Spread:**
```
Lighthouse: 000° (ahead)
Church: 315° (port beam)
Water tower: 290° (port quarter)
Headland: 090° (starboard beam)

Bearing spreads:
- Lighthouse + Church: 45° (marginal)
- Lighthouse + Headland: 90° (excellent)
- Church + Water tower: 25° (poor)

Best combination: Lighthouse (000°) + Church (315°) + Headland (090°)
Spread: 45° + 90° + 135° (acceptable distribution)
```

**Step 4 - Confirm:**
```
✓ Lighthouse: White tower on breakwater, can't be missed
✓ Church: Prominent spire on hillside, no other churches visible
✓ Headland: Distinct rocky point, clearly Black Head

Ready to take bearings ✓
```

**Result:**
Good object selection leads to successful fix with small cocked hat (~0.2 NM).
