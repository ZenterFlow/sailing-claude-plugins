# SKILL: Pre-Departure Safety Briefing and Equipment Verification (SKILL_098)

## Description
Master comprehensive pre-passage safety briefing delivery and systematic equipment verification procedures for all vessel types, ensuring crew awareness of emergency protocols, equipment locations, and vessel-specific safety procedures before departure.

## Prerequisites
- None (Foundational Safety Skill)

## Learning Objectives
- Deliver vessel-specific safety brief covering all critical emergency equipment
- Verify operational readiness of safety equipment including life jackets, flares, and fire suppression systems
- Establish clear crew responsibilities and emergency communication protocols
- Document departure intentions with shore-based contacts

**Safety Brief Delivery Process**

**Pre-Brief Equipment Inspection:**
1. **Life Jacket Check:**
   - Examine for wear and tear, especially bladder folding creases
   - Verify gas bottle and automatic firing unit on inflatable models
   - Confirm gas bottle is correct size and rust-free
   - Check crotch strap adjustment, light functionality, whistle, oral inflation tube, and reflective tape
   - Ensure integral harness and spray hood are fitted where appropriate

2. **Flare Inventory Check:**
   - Verify seal integrity on canisters (damaged seals indicate damp, useless flares)
   - Confirm quantities: 4 red rocket, 4 red hand-held, 2 orange smoke, 2 white warning flares typical
   - Check expiration dates and service history
   - Note different manufacturer activation methods

3. **Fire Extinguisher Verification:**
   - Inspect for annual service tags
   - Check pressure gauges on dry powder units
   - Test by tilting and listening for powder movement
   - Confirm proper sizing for vessel compartments

4. **Gas System Safety Check:**
   - Test shut-off valve operation in galley
   - Verify gas bottles stored in external-draining locker
   - Check approved hose condition and connections
   - Test manual bilge pump effectiveness for gas evacuation

**Safety Brief Content Delivery:**

**Mandatory Discussion Points:**
1. **Life Jacket and Harness Protocol:**
   - Demonstrate proper donning and adjustment
   - Identify jackstay locations (canvas straps running along side decks)
   - Show harness attachment points and clip-on procedures
   - Emphasize: NEVER clip to guard rails (not designed for load)
   - State RYA policy: Wear at all times unless skipper exempts; mandatory for non-swimmers, night ops, fog, reefing, dinghy use

2. **Emergency Communication:**
   - VHF Channel 16 operation and DSC mayday button sequence
   - EPIRB/SART location and activation procedures
   - Emergency VHF aerial location if available
   - Personal AIS beacon operation for MOB situations

3. **Man Overboard Equipment:**
   - Location and deployment of MOB equipment
   - Life raft launching procedure
   - Life ring drogue attachment to prevent wind drift

4. **Fire Emergency Response:**
   - Fire extinguisher and blanket locations
   - Engine compartment fire protocol: NEVER open engine bay (oxygen feed)
   - Automatic extinguisher access hole location
   - Engine fire specific actions

5. **Vessel Operations Brief:**
   - Engine start procedure and spare parts location (oil, impellers, filters, belts)
   - Heads operation and rules (what can/cannot be flushed)
   - Galley safety: cooker operation, gas shut-off, fire blanket use
   - Dinghy boarding/loading procedures and painter length limits
   - Radar reflector deployment (collapsible vs fixed types)

**Shore Contact Establishment:**

**Information to Provide:**
- Start/end points with intermediate ports
- ETA and "latest arrival" times for each destination
- Proposed ports of refuge
- Vessel details: type, length, registration, crew number, provisions
- Safety and communication equipment inventory
- Passage plan accounting for leeway and tidal effects

**Communication Methods:**
- Radio voyage plan to coastguard (Safetrx registration scheme)
- Submit movement form to club/organization
- Use RYA Safetrx app for automated tracking
- Designate shore contact person with instructions to raise alarm if not checked in

**Pre-Departure Provisioning Verification:**
- Sufficient food, water, fuel (7/8 full to prevent splash-back), gas
- Warm clothing and dry bedding for all crew
- First aid kit location and inventory
- Rigging cutters accessibility

## Common Errors
- Delivering generic brief without vessel-specific equipment locations
- Failing to physically demonstrate equipment operation during brief
- Omitting crotch strap adjustment on life jackets
- Neglecting to check flare expiration dates before departure
- Incomplete shore contact information (missing "latest arrival" time)
- Not accounting for leeway in passage plan shared with shore contacts
- Forgetting to brief crew on heads operational limits

## Assessment
- Conduct complete pre-departure equipment verification checklist
- Deliver comprehensive safety brief to crew covering all 15+ mandatory items
- Demonstrate proper life jacket inspection and fitting procedure
- Successfully register passage plan with coastguard or designated shore contact
- Identify and locate all fire fighting equipment and describe specific use cases
- Execute VHF DSC mayday test sequence (non-emergency) and verbal mayday format recitation
